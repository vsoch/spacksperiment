The package files can undo the default\r\n    setting by using the -qfree option (as the last option wins.)\r\n    The problem occurs when cmake builds test programs to detect compiler\r\n    capabilities, as it uses the default flags.  Consequently, f90 test\r\n    programs in free form will fail to build with the -qstrict flag.\r\n    \r\n    This commit changes the free form for the cmake test programs to strict\r\n    form, to allow the use of both f77 and f90 compilers.\r\n    \r\n    Install cmake under spack for XL compilers as follows:\r\n    \r\n    spack install cmake%xl_r+openssl+ncurses^openssl%gcc^ncurses%gcc\r\n    \r\n    This will build openssl and ncurses with the gcc compiler (there is\r\n    no openssl and ncurses code in the final math library) and cmake with\r\n    the xl(_r) compiler.\r\n",
