    "body": "The fltk package can build libraries with opengl support. By default, the configure script looks for opengl headers in the sytem include paths. If 'devel' packages have not been installed on the system, it omits the `ftlk_gl.so` library. This can break packages like 'octave' which expects 'fltk' to have opengl support and looks for the library 'fltk_gl'.\r\n\r\nMake opengl support explicit in fltk by adding a dependency on 'gl' and adding a new variant of the same name 'gl' (default On).\r\n\r\nWith these modifications, I was able to build `fltk_gl` and `octave` successfully on CentOS8.\r\n\r\nBuild instructions: https://www.fltk.org/doc-1.3/intro.html",
