    "body": "Why doesn't anyone support non-GCC compilers? :sob: \n\nTrying to build NetCDF with PGI. NetCDF depends_on OpenSSL, which is crashing during the build. See [spack-build-original.txt](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/180034/spack-build-original.txt). Going off of the error messages, I tried adding:\n\n``` python\nfilter_file(r'-Wall', '', 'Makefile')\nmake(\"depend\")\n```\n\nbut no luck. See [spack-build-Wall.txt](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/180035/spack-build-Wall.txt).\n\nAny thoughts? This seems to be a recurring problem. I am able to build OpenSSL outside of Spack, but I think that's only because they hard code it to use GCC. When I replace `CC=gcc` with `CC=pgcc` I get the same problems.\n",
