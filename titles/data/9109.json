Spack is reporting that there is no CMakeLists.txt in the tar.gz for this package. It is quite correct, there is not. However, nlopt/package.py is very clear that this is a CMakePackage. The contents of the tar.gz indicate that it is actually an AutoTools package. \r\n\r\nThe checksum for the tar.gz is identical to the one given in the package.py, so I am clearly working with the same file as the original author of the package.py, but I can't see how it could ever have worked. \r\n\r\nI thought I had better ask, rather than dive in and break things, in case I have missed something fundamental.
