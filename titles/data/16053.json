Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n1. I have no clue why this install would be referencing header files under the Xcode app:\r\n```console\r\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/Security.framework/Headers/Authorization.h:193:7: error: variably modified 'bytes' at file scope\r\n  char bytes[kAuthorizationExternalFormLength];\r\n       ^~~~~\r\n```\r\n2. I'm not understanding the compiler error. The make error output doesn't seem to point back to any particular glib source file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\nStarting from a clean slate macOS Mojave (10.14.6) with latest XCode 11.3.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git\r\n$ git checkout releases/v0.14\r\n$ source share/spack/setup-env.sh\r\n$ spack install gcc@8.3.0  #Success, no errors reported\r\n$ spack compiler add $(spack location -i gcc@8.3.0)\r\n$ spack install glib %gcc@8.3.0\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nRegarding the issue template prompt, \"Please include the output of `spack debug report` \", I receive an error that `report` is not a valid subcommand.  Am I misunderstanding the request?\r\n\r\nThis is a Apple MacBook Pro 2019 - Skylake processor\r\nMacOS Mojave 10.14.6\r\nXCode 11.3.1 is installed which provides a clang 11.0 install that I'm trying **not** to use due to several other errors that looked more complicated.\r\nPython is installed by Anaconda.\r\n```\r\n$ which python\r\n//anaconda3/bin/python\r\n$ python --version\r\nPython 3.7.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/4478498/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/4478463/env.txt)\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` [yes](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/4478392/spack-db.releases-v0.14.e2b1737a4.2020-04-14-171733.tar.gz) and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n    - No maintainers listed.\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the [build log](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/4478498/spack-build-out.txt) and [environment files](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/4478463/env.txt)\r\n     - uploaded shell environment.\r\n     - `$ spack env list` `==> No environments`\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
