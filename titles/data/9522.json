I had to add a `shared` variant to Nalu-Wind so that I could use `sys.platform != 'darwin'` to turn `shared` on or off for Trilinos automatically since Trilinos won't build with STK as a shared library on Darwin anymore.\r\n\r\nI also changed a FIXME comment in Trilinos that doesn't need to be fixed in my opinion and `hdf5+hl` is fine as it is.\r\n\r\nAlso, Nalu-Wind is the official ECP application and not Nalu, so I updated the tags to reflect this.",
