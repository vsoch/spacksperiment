Truth be told it builds (for me) without this, but I'm assuming that they're there for a reason...).\r\n- tune up dependencies\r\n  - need tbb\r\n  - don't need readline or zlib\r\n\r\nSeveral things were installed with sbang's that use `/usr/bin/env` to fine perl or python.  Fix the dependency and clean up the sbang lines.",
