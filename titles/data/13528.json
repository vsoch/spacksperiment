Many projects don't just use develop or master - git flow style development with feature branches is common. To solve this, the ability to specify a git reference in place of version would be great, for packages that have git sources.\r\n\r\nWithout this ability, only manually transcribed branches can be developed against, and branches with characters like \"/\" are not supported.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSomething like spack dev-build my-package@git-ref:feature/foo. I don't know how else you deconflict with other arbitrary version names.",
