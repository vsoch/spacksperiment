    "body": "Importance sampling from the truncated multivariate normal using the GHK\r\n(Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane) simulator. Unlike Gibbs sampling which can\r\nget stuck in one truncation sub-region depending on initial values, this\r\npackage allows truncation based on disjoint regions that are created by\r\ntruncation of absolute values. The GHK algorithm uses simple Cholesky\r\ntransformation followed by recursive simulation of univariate truncated\r\nnormals hence there are also no convergence issues. Importance sample is\r\nreturned along with sampling weights, based on which, one can calculate\r\nintegrals over truncated regions for multivariate normals.",
