    "body": "This PR adds the BART (Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolset)\r\npackage.\r\n\r\nDespite the presence of CMake files, this package builds with a\r\nMakefile. It looks like the project is moving away from cmake. The patch\r\nfor MKL has been committed upstream so should only be necessary for this\r\nversion of BART.  The Makefile patch is meant for working with Spack and\r\nwould not be useful upstream. The bart scripts are still setup to use\r\nbart with the subcommands being individual binaries. This patches those\r\nto use the single binary with built-in subcommands and assumes that\r\nspack is providing the TOOLBOX environment variable and setting PATH.",
