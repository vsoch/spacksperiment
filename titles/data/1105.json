    "body": "Whenever I installed a package that filters things like compiler wrappers, I noticed backup files like `mpicc~` and `mpicxx~` everywhere, despite the fact that backup is set to False in the filter_file kwargs. I tracked this down to two separate bugs in `filter_file()`:\n1. `backup` is initialized as a Boolean variable that decides whether or not we want to backup our files. It is later overwritten as a filename for the backup file. At the end, it is used in an if-statement to decide whether or not we want to delete the backups. Since a non-empty string is always True, `filter_file()` thought we wanted to keep the backup files. The fix was to use two separate variable names.\n2. During deletion, `filter_file()` was calling `shutil.rmtree()`, which recursively deletes directories. Since `backup_filename` is a regular file and not a directory, it was raising an error. But since ignore_errors was set to True, it didn't complain to the user. I replaced `shutil.rmtree()` with `os.remove()`.\n",
