    "body": "I'm thinking about adding Scons as a build system to Spack, similar to how Autotools and CMake are already integrated. This typically involves running `scons build [options]` and `scons install`, however, it can be done in parallel with `scons -j16 build [options]`. When running `spack create`, I would like it to detect whether or not the package should be built with Scons (as evidenced by the presence of a `SConstruct` file) and add these commands to the new package. It should obviously work with `spack install -j16` or `parallel = false`. And you shouldn't have to run `which(scons)` to run `scons('build', *options)`.\n\nCan someone point me to all of the necessary files I need to edit?\n",
