This PR can be reviewed in favor of #24317 as it also includes the fix.\r\n\r\n@alecbcs this is likely what you want in favor of rolling your own interaction with the API. This also includes a bug fix that we need to save the temporary build id with the build metadata (to match to other results) instead of the spec hash.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
