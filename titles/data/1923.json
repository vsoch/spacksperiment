    "body": "I can no longer build `trilinos ^mkl` because `spec['blas'].prefix.lib` does not point to the correct directory for MKL.  At least for my installation, the MKL libraries are located at `$MKLROOT/lib/intel64` and not at  `$MKLROOT/lib`.  I'm not sure how to fix this because I don't know if there is significant variation in directory names for MKL installations. \n\nIt is simple to modify the trilinos recipe to do something special for MKL.  Should I submit a PR with these changes?  Does anyone else have experience building trilinos against MKL? Are there other configurations that I should be aware of?\n",
