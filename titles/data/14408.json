    "body": "It would seem that the Spack cmake/package.py file is set up to build a **no optimized** version of CMake by default.  I noticed this a few months ago when we were almost going to try to use the Spack-installed env but then noticed this that the Spack-installed cmake was about 2.5x slower than correctly built CMake.  Here are the configure times for the Primary Tested Trilinos suite on my super fast Linux machine:\r\n\r\nInstall Method | CMake version | Runtime\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nSEMS | 3.12.2 | 2m30.498s\r\nTriBITS | 3.11.1 | 2m29.507s\r\nSpack | 3.14.5 | 7m47.042s\r\n\r\nUntil we can fix this, CMake as installed by spack is unusable for SNL ATDM :-(\r\n\r\nThe proper way to build an optimized CMake is shown in:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/TriBITSPub/TriBITS/blob/master/tribits/devtools_install/install-cmake.py#L172\r\n\r\nand that shows how to do a fast parallel configure too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
