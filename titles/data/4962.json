Spack does not have a package that provides the OpenGL libraries. I thought `mesa` was supposed to, but it clearly isn't working. This PR disables the variant by default. If you happen to have OpenGL installed on your system and want to build `qt+opengl`, be my guest. But if you don't, the default variant should not fail for you.\r\n\r\nP.S. We are missing the vast majority of Qt's dependencies. Run `./configure -list-libraries` if you are curious.\r\n\r\nP.P.S. I hate Qt",
