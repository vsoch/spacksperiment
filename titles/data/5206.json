    "body": "I am working on adding several tomography packages. While my group exclusively uses them via their python interfaces (and that's pretty common), about a quarter of the wider community is likely to use them via Matlab, C++, or IDL. Naming the package py- would normally make sense, but then it would seem to be Python-exclusive. What's the best practice for naming in such situations?\r\n\r\nLikewise, one of the packages astra-toolkit is very similar in name to astra. In naming packages - and options for variants - is there a best practice when there are similarities in name that just seem likely to trip up the concretizer. I'm thinking of the qmcpack spec when:\r\n\r\n depends_on('espresso@5.3.0+qmcpack~elpa', when='+mpi')\r\n\r\nand we went with to get around it:\r\n\r\n depends_on('espresso@5.3.0+qmcpackconv~elpa', when='+mpi')\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nWilliam",
