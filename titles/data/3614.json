This feature is listed as being up-for-grabs.\r\n\r\nI have added support for perl extensions, using R extensions as a guide.\r\n\r\nPerl packages use a variety of build methods, some of which are not provided by the core perl distribution. As a test of my perl extension code, I have included an extension that provides one of the common \"unofficial\" build methods: perl-module-build.",
