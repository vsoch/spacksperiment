Output to user's stdout should be displayed in almost real time as a process executes. \r\nUnit tests which depend on logging can now be executed (many may still not pass, but they are running on Windows)\r\nTo test: \r\n`spack install cpuinfo` (or another package known to be windows compatible)\r\n`spack unit-test lib\\spack\\spack\\test\\views.py` (or git_fetch, spec_dag, spec_yaml, test_activations, etc)",
