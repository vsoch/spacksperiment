Using a cron job to mark stale issues and eventually close them after a grace period might be a way to keep the two lists more manageable. \r\n\r\nThe configuration values I pushed here are of course subject to discussion. The current configuration is:\r\n-  issues that are marked with certain labels are exempted from the check \r\n-  if an issue is marked as stale anybody has 30 days to perform any activity on it (in which case it will be unmarked)",
