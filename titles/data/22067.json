(See e.g. `CudaPackage` mixin class.)\r\n\r\nThis also simplifies downstream usage in multi-variants for backends in user code.\r\nAlso, `blaspp` will not fail to build on macOS by default (no CUDA anymore on macOS).\r\n\r\nThe other BLAS++ dependent in Spack at the moment, `slate`, controls the BLAS++ variant in `depends_on` explicitly and needs no change.\r\n\r\ncc @G-Ragghianti @mgates3",
