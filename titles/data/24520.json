    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI've been trying to install and run code with the `spack` module `openpmd-api`, but have found a `HDF5`-apparent error message with it (reported in https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api/issues/1021).\r\n\r\n@ax3l has been helping me and suggested that I tried to use `spack` environments instead.\r\nAlthough all the modules were installed via `spack`, when installing them in a new environment, `zstd` was re-installed, and `gmp` was starting to be installed, but gave an error message (which is why I am writing this issue and which I don't know how to solve).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nInitial installation of packages:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install gcc\r\n$ spack compiler find\r\n$ spack load gcc\r\n$ spack compiler find\r\n$ spack install cmake\r\n$ spack load cmake\r\n$ spack install mpich\r\n$ spack load mpich\r\n$  spack install openpmd-api\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreation of the environment (ending with `gmp` installation error):\r\n```console\r\n$ spack env create opmd\r\n$  spack env activate opmd\r\n$  spack add cmake\r\n$ spack add mpich\r\n$  spack add gcc\r\n$  spack add openpmd-api\r\n$  spack concretize\r\n$  spack find -c\r\n$  spack install\r\n```\r\n\r\nError messages and more detailed view of what I did/got are in:\r\n[spack_env_shell.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6715097/spack_env_shell.txt)\r\n\r\n### Information on my (Windows 10 local machine) system\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-3140-ca1d1c427c\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.2\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have changed *spack/etc/spack/defaults/packages.yaml* line to `mpi: [mpich, openmpi]` to build with mpich by default.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [[spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6715090/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6715092/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\n@ ax3l\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
