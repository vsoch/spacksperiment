    "body": "@fpruvost, @trws: This should fix the VCS mirror fetching issues.  Please let me know if it works for you and I'll merge.\n\n@alalazo: I tried to keep this PR minimal so as not to interfere with your `CompositeFetchStrategy` stuff, but it may conflict with some of your changes.  The way fetching/stages/mirroring should really be reworked, and I think your refactor will help that.  I think eventually I'd like to combine the local tarball caching with mirroring, so that if you fetch a package, you fetch into a common directory or into a local mirror in ~/.spack. Staging would still be per-build, but tarballs wouldn't be redundantly fetched for each build.  I can take a look at that after your resource stuff is done -- we'll need to think about how that relates to mirroring too.\n- Stage and fetcher were not being set up properly when fetching using\n  a different fetch strategy than the default one for the package.\n- This is fixed but fetch/stage/mirror logic is still too complicated\n  and long-term needs a rethink.\n- Spack will now print a warning when fetching a checksum-less tarball\n  from a mirror -- users should be careful to use https or local\n  filesystem mirrors for this.\n",
