    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am aware of the `spack-tools` workflow to build compilers and other tools (e.g. CMake) in a second instance of spack.\r\n\r\nCompilers are (in my na\u00efve world-view) bootstrapped.\r\nI found that compiling them externally first blows up the \"getting started\" workflow quite a bit for users (not me personally, but *users*).\r\n\r\nBut especially for CUDA C++ programs, there are [quite some limitations](https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132) on which compilers we are able to use...\r\n\r\nIs there a fundamental reason we can't mark packages \"bootstrapped\", such as compilers so we can use and trigger their build when requested in a spec? This would make spack so much more powerful to the average user!\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack install boost %gcc@5.3.0\r\n# oh you don't have a GCC 5.3.0!\r\n# I will just bootstrap one for you\r\n# ... here we go\r\n# ... and now I even add it to your compilers.yaml and packages.yaml lists\r\n#      (\uff89\uff9f\u25bd\uff9f)\uff89\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this a planned feature (or did I overlook an issue for it)?\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack install gcc@5.3.0\r\n# Can this package be bootstrapped? Yes, so I will forget its dependencies for you\r\n# ... here we go\r\n# huh, this is a compiler!\r\n# ... now I even add it to your compilers.yaml and packages.yaml lists\r\n#      (\uff89\uff9f\u25bd\uff9f)\uff89\r\n```",
