    "body": "In order to minimize unnecessary duplication and solve other logistical issues with certain package combinations, we (Fermilab, as packagers / distributors and software providers for the HEP community) need to be able to have a package which is built with a particular compiler / flag combination and/or dependencies but which does not confer those dependencies on packages which depend upon it. Examples would be executable-only packages (compilers themselves, or code generators such as XST), or C-only libraries such as FFTW or SQLite. A GCC-7.3/C++17 package which uses / links against FFTW can happily do so, even when FFTW was built with the native GCC, and both the concretization / build procedure and module activation system should be able to deal with this.\r\n\r\nRelated: we also need to be able to specify \"NULL\" packages ie. neither needing nor depending on a compiler (e.g. data-only packages), binary-only packages (third-party pre-compiled packages for deployment) and packages with runtime dependency specifications but no source to build (\"umbrella\" packages).\r\n\r\nHave I misread the documentation, and any or all of this is already possible with suitable configuration?",
