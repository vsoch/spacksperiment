    "body": "Currently, `openmpi` has there implicit dependencies, which it tries to find in the system directories (see  `_verbs_dir()`, `_mxm_dir()`, and `_tm_dir()`). This PR makes those dependencies explicit and the users now can specify custom prefixes to those libraries in `packages.yaml`.\r\n\r\n1. Function `_verbs_dir()` is removed. Instead, `openmpi` depends on `rdma-core`:\r\n    ```python\r\n    depends_on('rdma-core', when='fabrics=verbs')`\r\n    ```\r\n    If the users want to use libraries from the system directories, they need to specify `rdma-core` as an external package in `packages.yaml`:\r\n    ```yaml\r\n    packages:\r\n      rdma-core:\r\n        paths:\r\n          rdma-core: /usr\r\n          buildable: False\r\n    ```\r\n2. Function `_mxm_dir()` is removed. Instead, `openmpi` depends on a new dummy package `mxm`:\r\n    ```python\r\n   depends_on('mxm', when='fabrics=mxm')\r\n    ```\r\n    `mxm` can't be installed with Spack (at least for now) and needs to be specified in `packages.yaml`:\r\n    ```yaml\r\n    packages:\r\n      mxm:\r\n        paths:\r\n          mxm: /opt/mellanox/mxm\r\n          buildable: False\r\n    ```\r\n3. Function `_tm_dir()` is removed. Instead, `openmpi` depends on a new package ~`pbspro`~  `openpbs`:\r\n    ```python\r\n    depends_on('openpbs', when='schedulers=tm')\r\n    ```\r\n    ~`pbspro`~ `openpbs` can be installed with Spack. It depends on a new package `libical` and a new virtual package `sendmail` provided be a new real package `ssmtp`. Although ~`pbspro`~ `openpbs` can be installed with Spack, I can't guarantee that it will be usable: I don't have experience with the package to test it properly. Additionally, its scripts do not seem to properly account for the case when the package is installed to a non-system directory. Therefore, I would recommend the users to specify it as an external package too:\r\n    ```yaml\r\n    packages:\r\n      openpbs:\r\n        paths:\r\n          openpbs: /opt/pbs\r\n          buildable: False\r\n    ```\r\n4. Package `lsf` is updated to allow for:\r\n    ```console\r\n    $ spack spec openmpi schedulers=lsf\r\n    $ spack fetch lsf\r\n    ```",
