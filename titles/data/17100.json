Stream is simply the fastest and simplest reproducer.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install stream%intel@19.1.1.217\r\n2 errors found in build log: \r\n     35    f77 -O2 -c stream.f\r\n     36    f77 -O2 stream.o mysecond.o -o stream_f.exe\r\n  >> 37    ld: /dcsrsoft/spack/external/intel/2020u1/compilers_and_libraries_2020.1.217/linux/bin/intel64/../../lib/LLVMgold.so: error loading plugin: libimf.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n  >> 38    make: *** [stream_f.exe] Error 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build works correctly with Intel@19.1.0.166 and also with a dirty build environment\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack install stream%intel@19.1.0.166\r\n..\r\n..\r\n==> 172171: stream: Executing phase: 'edit'\r\n==> 172171: stream: Executing phase: 'build'\r\n==> 172171: stream: Executing phase: 'install'\r\n==> 172171: stream: Successfully installed stre\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$  spack load intel@19.1.1.217\r\n\r\n$ spack install --dirty stream%intel@19.1.1.217\r\n..\r\n..\r\n==> 172490: stream: Building stream [MakefilePackage]\r\n==> 172490: stream: Executing phase: 'edit'\r\n==> 172490: stream: Executing phase: 'build'\r\n==> 172490: stream: Executing phase: 'install'\r\n==> 172490: stream: Successfully installed stream\r\n  Fetch: 0.03s.
