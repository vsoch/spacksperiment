    "body": "spack supports Flat Naming Scheme when ``tcl`` is \r\nselected which will generate tcl modules. When spack use ``lmod`` it will generate Hierarchical Modules. There is no way to select Flat Naming Scheme when using lmod\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nMany HPC sites make use of lmod and Flat Naming Scheme is much easier to manage then \r\nHierarchical Modules due to many module trees due to compiler, mpi, numerical libs. Even if there is many modules it is easier to find modules using ``module spider`` rather than trying to \r\nhave user to hunt down the compiler, mpi to find the appropriate software. \r\n\r\nHierarchical Module becomes hard to manage for administrator when there is multiple combination of **compiler * mpi * numlibs**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPlease have support for Flat Naming Scheme when using lmod. According to https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module_file_support.html#module-file-customization the default template for lmod defined is implemented in https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/lib/spack/spack/modules/lmod.py. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n*Add any other context about the feature request here.*\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!",
