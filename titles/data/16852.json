I am trying to debug the NWChem install failure.  It says to review the log.  Which log?\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Error: Installation of nwchem failed.  Review log for details\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI can, of course, search my filesystem for this file, whose name I do not know, but it's not convenient.\r\n\r\nFor example, I looked for the log like this:\r\n```\r\n$ find /opt/spack/spack/ -name \"*nwchem*\"\r\n/opt/spack/spack/opt/spack/.spack-db/failures/nwchem-sgdfim2nm2myvi47fyjcpcnb3ct3phwj\r\n/opt/spack/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/nwchem\r\n```\r\nNeither file is a log.\r\n\r\nI am not interested in looking through 675 hits for the log I need...\r\n```\r\n$ find /opt/spack/spack/ -name \"*log*\" | wc -l\r\n675\r\n```\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.14.0-271-1bcc80ec5\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues?q=log+location was not particularly useful...",
