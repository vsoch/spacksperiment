I am not sure if I did the right thing with adding the two versions in the open-mpi example.\r\nMy packages.yaml now looks like this:\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n  openssl:\r\n    version: [2.2.7]\r\n    paths:\r\n      openssl@2.2.7: /usr/bin/openssl\r\n    buildable: False\r\n  cmake:\r\n    version: [2.9.5]\r\n    paths:\r\n      cmake@3.9.5: /usr/local/bin/cmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nand spack is now finding these!",
