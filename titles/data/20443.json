    "body": "#20161 broke the `freeglut` build on Linux because the `libs` property of the virtual `gl` package, which the reworked `freeglut` package uses, was not correctly provided by the `mesa` package.\r\n\r\nInvestigating this further revealed that the `libs` property could actually not be provided by the `mesa` package in the exact way that the `freeglut` package expects, because Mesa provides several libraries of which `libGL` is just one example, whereas `freeglut` expects the first entry of the virtual `gl` package's `libs` list to be `libGL`.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this problem that is proposed by the `mesa` package is to have multiple `libs` property: a `gl_libs` property, a `glx_libs` property, etc. So I implemented support for that in the dummy `opengl` package and asked `freeglut` to use that.\r\n\r\nNow I'm waiting for my new `freeglut` build to see whether this actually works.",
