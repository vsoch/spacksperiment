    "body": "Version 4 of the libtool/darwin debacle:\r\n\r\n`AutotoolsPackage` hardcodes `libtool` & `libtoolize` into the `autoreconf`\r\nstage, so the commands `libtool` and `libtoolize` MUST be present, and\r\nshimming in `glibtoolize` into `AutotoolsPackage` when `sys.platfrom ==\r\n'darwin'` does not work.\r\n\r\n`join_path(spec['libtool'].prefix.bin, 'libtool')` still shadows system\r\nBSD libtool (in `apple-cctools`, see PR #7177), but this shadowing could\r\nbe okay, depending on the combination of dependent specs.\r\n\r\nShould fix #7140, and hopefully partially address raised in #7172.
