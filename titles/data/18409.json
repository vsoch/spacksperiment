Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install r-boot%fj\r\n==> Error: ChecksumError: sha256 checksum failed for /home/users/ea01/ea0114/spack-stage/spack-stage-r-boot-1.3-23-mm6cmoaof62r5y527kz24snjifgwpir6/boot_1.3-23.tar.gz\r\n    Expected 30c89e19dd6490b943233e87dfe422bfef92cfbb7a7dfb5c17dfd9b2d63fa02f but got 79236a5a770dc8bf5ce25d9aa303c5dc0574d94aa043fd00b8b4c8ccc877357f\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuild of `r-boot%fj` on 2020 Aug has a checksum error.\r\nThis version added to spack at 31 Aug 2019. Please see https://github.com/spack/spack/commit/661a894c85f451a4ef868abcc9871653914361bd\r\nAccording to our log, same build succeeded on 2019 Oct. \r\n\r\nhttps://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/boot_1.3-23.tar.gz seems to be changed between these attempts.\r\nWe found old(30c89e19) boot_1.3-23.tar.gz from http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/pool/universe/b/boot/boot_1.3-23.orig.tar.gz\r\nand compared with new(79236a5a) one.\r\nDifference was tribial. (\"Date/Publication\" in boot/DESCRIPTION, and MD5 of the file in boot/MD5)\r\nSo I would like to update checksum value.\r\n\r\nWe have another question.\r\nIn this case, we found \"old\" archive and proof the differnce is trivial.\r\nIf we found checksum mismatch and could not find \"old\" archive to verify, \r\nwhich is better in view of security?\r\n1. create issue and discuss\r\n2. directly make PR\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
