    "body": "PR #261 adds support for a \"preferred version\" as a stopgap waiting for #120 and more generic preference mechanisms.  Neither of these seems to offer a mechanism for specifying versions that are available but unstable, and thus which shouldn't be used without explicit request.  The ability to use a masking flag, variant, or just something logically opposite to \"preferred\" might be a clean way to deal with adding things like \"HEAD\" versions for some packages without having to track a specific \"preferred\" version below that to keep it out of the list.  Using something like gentoo's mask names might make it a bit more flexible still, where packages can be stable, unstable, test, etc. and enabled only by specifying the levels to be unmasked.  That may be excessive here, but the basic concept would help.\n",
