Some of my users use `zsh` as their default shell. I've noticed that users who use `zsh` are getting the `command not found: complete`\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1. Create environment script  `/etc/profile.d/spack.sh`\r\n```console\r\nexport SPACK_ROOT=/opt/spack\r\n. $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.sh\r\n```\r\n2. Change shell to `zsh`\r\n3. Logout and relogin to your user account.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n```console\r\n/opt/spack/share/spack/spack-completion.bash:318: command not found: complete\r\n/opt/spack/share/spack/spack-completion.bash:321: command not found: complete\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-351-637620a40\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos8-broadwell\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
