    "body": "I believe that our documentation would increase its effectiveness if we add an \"How to\" part that deals in a very practical way with specific problems e.g. \"How do I install X on the system and set it up as an external in Spack?\" or \"How can I set environment variables to be used when I build or run a package?\"\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nSpack documentation has already excellent tutorial and reference sections. Tutorials focus on giving a quite in depth tour of Spack capabilities following a path that is viable for somebody that approaches the tool for the first time. The reference guide gives great details on the inner working of Spack and provides many times discussions on why certain choices have been made. What I think might be missing (based on recent discussions with a few users) is a section that is focused on common issues/needs that a user might face when employing Spack and explains how to solve them in a recipe-like style.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis proposal is basically to start a discussion on adding an \"How to\" section in the documentation. I think a good starting format might be that of many programming cookbooks, where you have:\r\n\r\n1. A brief statement on what is the problem that needs to be solved\r\n2. A solution that explains how to solve it in a series of steps\r\n3. Maybe a few brief notes or references at the end\r\n\r\nand it is assumed that the reader is already somewhat familiar with the tool.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIn case the proposal is well received there are possibly more details that needs to be fixed, like which categories to use for grouping how to recipes, how to make them searchable in an effective way etc. \r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
