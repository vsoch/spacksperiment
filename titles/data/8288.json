    "body": "@tgamblin @scheibelp @alalazo @adamjstewart \r\n\r\nI believe that all packages should concretize by default.  In other words, the command\r\n   `spack spec xyz`\r\n\r\nshould always work out-of-the-box.  Packages that do not concretize are embarssing, particularly when new users com across them.  See: \r\n    https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spack/wKcAathCgVo\r\n\r\nI suggest we test for concretization as follows:\r\n\r\nGlobal Tests\r\n=========\r\n\r\nPeriodically, we should run `spack spec xyz` for all packages, and post a list of packages that fail.  This test could be time consuming, so we don't run it too frequently; maybe once a weekI don't know how many fail right now; but the goal of course is to get this list down to zero.  We should continue to run the tests periodically to make sure we don't break concretization with changes to core Spack.\r\n\r\nIncremental Tests\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThe Travis test `spack spec xyz` should be added to any PR that creates or modifies a package.  And passing it should be a requirement for merging.\r\n",
