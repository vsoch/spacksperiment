    "body": "I was trying to build `gdal+hdf4` on macOS and found that I could no longer concretize the spec. It looks like what happened was that @skosukhin added a `rpc` dependency in #16469, and @michaelkuhn added the appropriate conflict to `libtirpc` on macOS in #17209. There are still a lot of packages in Spack that depend on `libtirpc`, not sure how we want to handle these.",
