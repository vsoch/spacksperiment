OpenSSL is installed, however, running `openssl md5 $FILE` will return an error, and `openssl sha256 $FILE` succeeds and outputs a SHA256 hash. Unfortunately, I don't have that much control over how this system is provisioned due to LLNL policy.\r\n\r\n### Conjecture\r\n\r\nMD5 isn't FIPS-compliant, so nothing in Spack that uses MD5 is going to work. Unfortunately, AFAICT, many packages in Spack use MD5...",
