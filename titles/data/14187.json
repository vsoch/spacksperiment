This appears to have worked for versions of python before 3.8.0 but does not appear to work any longer (as shown in #14102).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the initial pickle error observed in #14102 by extracting the locally-defined function into a top-level function def. \r\n\r\n(UPDATE 8/14/20) this currently avoids most pickling errors by serializing a Spec and passing it to `build_environment.fork` rather than passing the Spec object itself. This works for all cases except for `spack dev-build` which replaces the associated `package.stage`.\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n- [x] (8/14/20) make `spack dev-build` work with new changes",
