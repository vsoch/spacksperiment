I would expect the platform to remain `None` if further information is not given. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import spack.spec\r\n>>> s = spack.spec.Spec('zlib target=x86_64')\r\n>>> str(s)\r\n'zlib arch=linux-None-x86_64'\r\n>>> s.architecture.platform\r\n'linux'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nThere's no error message, but I would expect:\r\n```python\r\n>>> import spack.spec\r\n>>> s = spack.spec.Spec('zlib target=x86_64')\r\n>>> str(s)\r\n'zlib arch=None-None-x86_64'\r\n>>> s.architecture.platform\r\n'None'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis happens regardless of the system.
