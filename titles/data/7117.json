We can't keep around all builds as binary packages, but we can keep around some. \r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement the ability for authorized users to comment on PRs and trigger builds of specified dependents of the packages in the PR.  A user with Spack write access should be able to comment on a PR with syntax like `build: <spec>` and trigger the build of the specified spec.",
