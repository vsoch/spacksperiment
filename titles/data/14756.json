    "body": "The current Spack Julia package potentially installs a few julia\r\npackages, with the installation being controlled by variants. There are\r\na couple of problems with this.\r\n\r\nFirst, Julia handles packages very differently from systems such as R\r\nand Python. Julia requires write access to the repository directories in\r\norder for user installs of packages to work. If spack installs julia\r\npackages then there will be a repository, DEPOT_PATH, in the\r\ninstallation directory. If spack is used on an individual basis this\r\nwould work but would mean that package data is written to the spack\r\ninstallation directory after installation. If spack is used to provide\r\npackages for end users then user installs of julia packages will fail\r\ndue to lack of write access to the repository in the installation\r\ndirectory. It seems best for spack to just install julia without any\r\njulia packages, and drop the configuration for those packages.\r\n\r\nSecond, having spack install package as variants seems to be counter to\r\nhow spack works for other extendable systems, like R and Python. Julia\r\nshould be an extendable package in spack but it is not clear how to make\r\nthat work. As pointed out above, installing user packages requires write\r\naccess to the julia repositories, including the one in the install\r\ndirectory. Essentially, a user package installation will try to update\r\nmetadata for *all* julia repositories.  Furthermore, each of those\r\nrepositories, assuming one per package with spack, would need to have\r\nthe Project.toml files merged to present the package stack to julia.\r\nAgain, it seems best for spack to just install julia itself and not try\r\nto install julia packages, at least at this time. A good discussion on\r\nthis can be found at\r\n\r\nhttps://discourse.julialang.org/t/how-does-one-set-up-a-centralized-julia-installation/13922.\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- adds versions 1.2.0 and 1.3.1\r\n- removes variants that correspond to julia packages\r\n- changes python to build dependency as it seems to only be needed for\r\n  LLVM\r\n- the new versions can use Python-3\r\n- removes dependencies for packages\r\n- adds a conflict statement for Intel compiler, with comment\r\n- add a setup_build_environment method to find GCC libraries\r\n- make formatting consistent\r\n- adds JULIA_CPU_TARGET option to correspond with target to help with\r\n  running julia image on hardware older than build host\r\n- added intel build options, for when they can be used\r\n- removed code for installing packages\r\n- removed code for julia config that was needed for packages\r\n\r\nNote that versions below 0.5.1 fail to build, with or without these\r\nchanges. It is not clear why that is.\r\n\r\nfixes #9581\r\nfixes #5224",
