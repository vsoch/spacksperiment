    "body": "The rose library uses the `strtoflt128` and `quadmath_snprintf`\r\nfunctions. In order to successfully link the rose library, chill must\r\nalso link the GCC libquadmath library to resolve the two functions. This\r\npatch changes the chill build to include this library.\r\n\r\nChill will also not compile unless headers from the gmp and isl\r\nlibraries are found in the includes path. Two patches - one each for gmp\r\nand isl - modify the chill build process to add options to specify those\r\npaths. These options follow the similar pattern as seen with BOOSTHOME\r\nand ROSEHOME options which already exist in the chill build process.\r\n\r\nBecause of the addition of GMPHOME and ISLHOME options, build\r\nrequirements for gmp and isl are also added.",
