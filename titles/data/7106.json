XED only runs on\r\nx86.  It won't even build on powerpc.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing you'd want to handle this by adding a conflict().\r\nI want to say, conflict('arch != x86'), but I was unsure of the\r\ncorrect syntax for that.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a 1-line change, if someone can show me what the\r\ncorrect spec for that is.\r\n\r\nMark Krentel\r\n",
