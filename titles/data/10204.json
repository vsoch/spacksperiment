I have tested these changes on Linux and Mac.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm confused about is I have to add `depends_on('netcdf+parallel-netcdf')` in `trilinos-catalyst-ioss-adapter` because otherwise the concretizer will fail because `paraview` requests `netcdf` with no variants and the default for `netcdf` itself is `netcdf~parallel-netcdf`, but by using `netcdf` without variants in `paraview`, doesn't that say it shouldn't care about what variants `netcdf` uses?",
