This `test.py` script:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env spack-python\r\nimport spack.repo\r\nfor name in spack.repo.all_package_names():\r\n    spack.repo.path.get_pkg_class(name)\r\n```\r\n\r\ntakes ~8.5s on my machine on current `develop`.  With the changes included here, it takes 7.4s.  It's small but it makes a difference when importing lots of files.  The new concretizer will import a lot of packages, so I'm trying to speed this up.\r\n\r\n- [x] Avoid auto-creating `Spec` objects in `filename_for_package_name()` when all we need is a package name.\r\n- [x] Avoid calling `traverse()` in `SpecParser`",
