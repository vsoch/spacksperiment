    "body": "This is a follow up on #16827.\r\nIt all started with a package that has `python` as a `build` dependency and needs the `openmp_flag`:\r\n```python\r\n...\r\ndepends_on('python', type='build')\r\n...\r\ndef configure_args(self):\r\n    ...\r\n    cflags.append(self.compiler.openmp_flag)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nThe problem occurred when I tried to install the package with `intel` compiler. In this case, the result of `self.compiler.openmp_flag` depends on the version of the compiler. Getting the version requires running the compiler in a modified environment. The modifications imply module loading. The module loading function runs `sys.executable`. In my case, `sys.executable` is Python 3.6.10 from `/usr/bin` and the version of Python from the dependencies is an external installation of Python 3.8.2, which gets enabled with the environment module. As a result, the [command](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/29d1e1ba87edeee3daea941d11adc67a03fcc1dd/lib/spack/spack/util/module_cmd.py#L22) that is run by the module loading function fails with the following message:\r\n```console\r\nFatal Python error: Py_Initialize: Unable to get the locale encoding\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'encodings'\r\n```\r\nThe reason is that  `PYTHONHOME` points to the prefix of the `python` from the dependency tree and is incompatible with `sys.executable`. The solution is to run `sys.executable` with the original value of `PYTHONHOME`. This is what we already have for `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. I also think that we should do the same for `PYTHONPATH`.\r\n\r\nI also found and fixed a couple of things that bother me in the current implementation:\r\n1. The current implementation [overwrites](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/29d1e1ba87edeee3daea941d11adc67a03fcc1dd/lib/spack/spack/util/module_cmd.py#L36) `SPACK_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` that is set here (to the same value but still): https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/29d1e1ba87edeee3daea941d11adc67a03fcc1dd/lib/spack/spack/main.py#L697-L703\r\n2. There is often a difference between an empty environment variable and an environment variable that is not set.\r\n3. A side effect of the current implementation is `SPACK_NEW_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in the building environment.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, all of this doesn't seem to be important when there is only `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to take care of.",
