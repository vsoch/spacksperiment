    "body": "The mesa software has many configuration options and use cases, and several spack contributors have independently developed their own spack packages for mesa. At one stage, there were 4 open PRs for mesa: #4134 (@luigi-calori), #4258 (@mjwoods), #4316 (@JusticeForMikeBrown), and #4602 (@olesenm).\r\n\r\n@olesenm took the initiative and attempted to create a unified branch containing all of the best ideas from the other branches (see https://github.com/olesenm/spack/tree/mesa-unified). Initial discussion of the issues was taken off-line, and later comments are recorded towards the end of #4602.\r\n\r\nThe current PR takes the \"unified branch\" of @olesenm a step further by ensuring that libGLES and libGL are built for all variants of the package. These libraries provide basic OpenGL support for other packages (e.g. qt). I have tested that the latest package builds successfully on RHEL6&7 for all variants and versions of the package, using both gcc@4.8.5 and gcc@6.3.0. Several mesa versions and variants also build on RHEL6 with the system compiler (gcc@4.4.7).",
