    "body": "This PR updates bcftools to 1.10.2 and is dependent on PR #14504.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes builds of other versions. Versions 1.2-1.4 did not\r\nuse autotools so when the packaeg was converted to use autotools with\r\nversion 1.6 those older versions could no longer build. Also, those\r\nversions needed to be patched to use an external htsllib. The method of\r\nfinding the external htslib is also different for those older versions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR adds two variants to bcftools:\r\n\r\n- libgsl\r\n- perl-filters\r\n\r\nFinally, dependencies for perl and python are added, and an unused\r\ndependency for libzip was removed.",
