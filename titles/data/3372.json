    "body": "When I install a package on macOS, I often prefer to install with my own version of `gcc@6`. However, certain packages don't build with GCC, and require Apple's Clang instead. The packages that require Clang are often \"unimportant\" for my application (bison, cmake, gettext, pkg-config, python).\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunately very difficult to tell Spack \"build everything with `%gcc`, except for these few packages\". I end up having to specify a compiler for almost every package. If I don't, Spack might make a wrong choice, and use Clang for a package which I need to have installed via GCC. (For example, if package A requires B, and B contains C++ code that is linked in, then it needs to be built with GCC as well.)\r\n\r\nIn the end, this means that I need to run `spack spec` to find out what dependencies there are, and explicitly list most of these with `%gcc`. This is amazingly tedious.\r\n\r\nI would like to have a feature where I tell Spack: \"Install all packages with `%gcc`, except for those packages where I explicitly specify something different\".",
