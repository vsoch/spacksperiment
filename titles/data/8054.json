But if you run it again for an already installed package, then the stage is silently deleted and an empty folder is re-created as there is nothing to install.\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\n`spack install --keep-stage` should keep existing stages if the package is already installed. \r\n\r\n### Actual Result\r\n\r\nexisting stage is silently removed.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install --keep-stage \r\n```\r\ntwice in a row for the same spec.\r\n",
