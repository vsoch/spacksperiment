This will break spack.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\nTrinitite is a an unclassified computing cluster for ASC code developers who target the Trinity platform. Cray CLE, based on SLES. The compute nodes run a Lightweight Operating System (LWOS), while both the (external) front-end nodes and (internal) login nodes run the fully featured OS. The Cray User Guide is a useful document for users and developers. See the Cray Documentation for complete information.     2 front-end nodes, external to the interconnect\r\n\r\n    100 compute nodes with Intel Haswell processor, and\r\n    100 compute nodes with an Intel Knights Landing (KNL) processor\r\n\r\n    32 CPU cores per Haswell compute node (2x hyperthreads each), and\r\n    68 CPU cores per KNL (4x hyperthreads each)\r\n\r\n    Haswell, per node: 128 GB Memory,\r\n    KNL, per node: 16 GB Multi-Channel Dynamic Random Access Memory (MCDRAM), aka. High-bandwidth memory (HBM)\r\n    96 GB Double Data Rate Random Acess Memory (DDRAM)\r\n\r\n    Peak speed = 100 HSW nodes * 32 cores * 2.3 GHz * 8 Flops/clock = 59 TFlops\r\n    + 100 KNL nodes * 68 cores * 1.4 GHz * 2 FMAs/core * 16 ops/clock/FMA = 305 Tflops\r\n    for a grand total of 364 TFlops*. \r\n\r\nI searched your documentation, but didn't find anything about this routine (lsb_release). Is there a workaround for this issue?\r\n",
