    "body": "So, what is the right way to handle a package name change like this? \r\n\r\n1. Keep boxlib package and add new AMReX package\r\n   - What happens to all the `depends_on('boxlib'...` in all the other packages\r\n   - Why maintain two copies of basically same package?\r\n1. Change boxlib package to AMReX and update all `depends_on('boxlib'...` instances\r\n   - Then, spack would loose knowledge of the boxlib name entirely and might be confusing for folks who have yet to catch up with the name change.\r\n1. Change boxlib package to AMReX but define a 'boxlib' alias for it (can we do that?)\r\n\r\nI like 3rd option best because it maintains knowledge of the old name\r\n",
