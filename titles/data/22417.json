    "body": "Beginning with version 2.4.1, the python interpreter line changed from\r\n\r\n\"#!/usr/bin/env python\" to \"#!/usr/bin/env python3\"\r\n\r\nThat caused the bowtie2-build and bowtie2-inspect scripts to have a\r\ntrailing '3' at the end of the interpreter line. This PR fixes that. I\r\nalso observed that older versions do not build with intel-oneapi-tbb\r\nso added a conflicts statement for that.",
