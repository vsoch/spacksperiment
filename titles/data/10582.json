    "body": "@scheibelp @tgamblin \r\nThe older version of Spack Environments supported multiple layered configurations.  For example in `env.yaml`:\r\n```\r\nenv:\r\n    configs:\r\n        - '../configs/centos7'            # Lowest precedence\r\n        - '../configs/gissversions'\r\n        - '../configs/twoway'\r\n        - '../configs/develop'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm having a hard time finding this feature in the current (merged) version (see #9612).  The documents show how you can put a configuration in-line into the `config` section of your environment's `spack.yaml` file.   But no mention of INCLUDING external configs (and having them override each other), rather than just having your own.\r\n\r\nLooking into the source code... I see the `include` feature turns up in `spack/schema/env.py` (#9612).  But the `env.py` schema is not included in the top-level `spack.py` schema, so I don't see how this feature can be accessed.  I would think that `spack/schema/env.py` is vestigal, except it seems to be used in unit tests.  Can you tell me the purpose of this file?\r\n\r\nHelp!  Please:\r\n\r\n1. Does Spack currently support this feature, of including external configs into an environment, that was in the beta version of Environments?\r\n\r\n2. If it does not, how would suggest I approach getting it included?  This is an essential feature for my needs.\r\n",
