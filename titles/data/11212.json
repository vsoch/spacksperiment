    "body": "There are two separate CMake related fixes in the PR:\r\n\r\n- cflags and cxxflags are not getting passed into CMake automatically. This causes problems when they are added either in packages.yaml or at the command line interface. A long term solution would be to add this kind of functionality into the CMake base package. However, it appears that many CMake Spack packages are already passing these flags explicitly into their own CMake.\r\n- We need to add Intel's `ifcore` library into the link line. It is needed when linking a Fortran library, compiled by the Intel compiler, into the QMCPACK binary. This does not happen with GCC. Not sure if the responsibility should rest with the Intel compiler or QMCPACK's CMake. ",
