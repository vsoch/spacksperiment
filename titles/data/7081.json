    "body": "Stack the local spack repository on top of a remote repository that contains pre-built packages, thereby avoiding building packages twice.\r\n\r\nEssentially, this adds installed packages in remote read-only spack installations (on the same system) to the current spack repository.\r\n\r\n*Motivation:*\r\nIn our group we have a set of pre-built packages that reside in their own spack repository and are available system-wide in a read-only fashion. Up until now there seemed to be no \"proper\" way to use these packages as dependencies for locally built specs in a seperate spack repository.\r\n\r\nEspecially, this is useful when debugging new `package.py`s against the installed set of packages. Previously the whole spack database had to be built a second time.\r\n\r\n*Implementation:*\r\nWe symlink all installed specs from the remote repository into the local `opt/spack`-path and reindex.\r\nBecause everything is linked via `RPATH`s, the remote package will have to reside where they are (hence no option to use hardlinks right now). When compiling packages in the local spack repository, the `RPATH`s might point to symlinks, however, I do not expect this to be an issue.\r\n\r\nComments?",
