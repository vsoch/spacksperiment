    "body": "Spack removes a package's `.git` directory when archiving in to a mirror.  Some packages query the `.git` directory during their CMake phase, like Dakota.  If `.git` does not exist, the CMake phase can fail.  I'd like there to be an option to not remove the `.git` directory on request.  Something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyPackage(Package):\r\n    archive_vcs_dirs = True\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\nSee discussion with @becker33 at https://spackpm.slack.com/archives/C5VL7V81G/p1605311764281100",
