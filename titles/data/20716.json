    "body": "A package object can implement `dynamic_deps` to inspect its associated spec and add dependencies accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative to https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/20502. Unlike #20502, this does not modify the hashing algorithm, but for the same use case it requires defining new package classes (both this PR and #20502 include a new test in `spec_deps` addressing the same use case, so you can see the work involved in each case).\r\n\r\nThis PR takes inspiration from https://github.com/alalazo/spack/commit/d130a6943ee663bf65b6565b656f1611c15067d9, although this PR differs in that it leaves the package class untouched.\r\n\r\n@tgamblin FYI",
