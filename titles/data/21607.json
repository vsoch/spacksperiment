This introduces an unnecessary implicit cmake dependency, which increases build time for meson considerably. cmake is only one of many methods for finding dependencies (pkg-config, qmake etc.), which are also not runtime dependencies of meson. Add cmake as a build dependency to mesa instead.\r\n\r\ncc @chuckatkins",
