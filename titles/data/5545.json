A restriction is, that the root directory of the tarball must be a directory which contains the distribution.\r\n\r\nTo generate the mount bind and chroot calls in uses namespaces.\r\nUnfortunately it does not support the separation of the PID namespace, due to the fact, that Python cannot read C defines and structs.\r\n",
