Now, everything in `/etc/spack` is ignored except for `/etc/spack/defaults`. This lets users put whatever configuration-related files they want in `/etc/spack` and track it with git. Tested with git 1.7.1 (the default on CentOS 6) and 2.5.0 (Spack installed) but would appreciate more testing.\r\n\r\nThanks to @svenevs for the solution!",
