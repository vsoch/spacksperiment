Take this as an hotfix, because I have the feeling that there are deeper inconsistencies that should be taken care of in the long term, e.g.\r\n\r\n1. `spec is not spec.package.spec` holds also after this PR, I just cured the symptoms\r\n2. `package.module` is inconsistent with the reality of things as it always points to a `package.py` in the current repo (while it should point imho to the `package.py` stored under `<prefix>/.spack`)\r\n\r\nLet me know if you want me to open new issues to keep track of the things above",
