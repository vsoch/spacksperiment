    "body": "Despite cmake being installed without spack, and spack being instructed to use the existing installation, spack reports that it cannot build cmake on my Mac with gcc.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nInstall cmake on MacOS without spack. Add its path in your `packages.yaml` file, setting `buildable: false`. Make sure to have gcc installed (e.g. using homebrew) and detected by spack. Then try to have spack install any package that requires cmake, and you will see this error:\r\n\r\n> CMake does not compile with GCC on macOS yet, use clang\r\n\r\nEven though cmake is installed, spack is not asked to install it.\r\n\r\nI have the same error with Python (Python does not compile with GCC on macOS yet, use clang), even though I have installed Python 3.7 using Anaconda and pointed spack to it in my packages.yaml file.",
