    "body": "The use of hierarchical modules such as Lmod has been discussed.  However, Lmod is hard to install and non-standard.  Maybe a better way to get the same effect would be for Spack to statically generate modules that would have the same effects as recursive modules.  This would have the benefit of being fast as well.  To be specific...\n\nSuppose we have package A that depends on B and C.  Spack builds B and C first, and writes B.mod and C.mod.  When writing A.mod, Spack would combine module information provided by the package, plus information already in B.mod and C.mod, to create A.mod.  A.mod would therefore add ALL paths in B.mod and C.mod.\n\nAny thoughts on this?\n",
