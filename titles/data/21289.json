Trying a first solve with a reduced number of facts (only preferred targets, compilers and providers)\r\n2. Reverting back to solve using all the facts we know if 1 is unsat\r\n\r\nI'll post data on the speed-up in the comments below, but most of the time it's roughly a 30%-50% cut of the wall-time compared to `develop`. \r\n\r\nBeing based on an heuristic reduction of the search space, I found during development that sometimes 1. may yield different results than 2. when soft-preferences are involved. One thing we should decide during review is therefore if we want this strategy to be:\r\n- hard-wired like it is now (maybe skipped in potentially problematic cases)\r\n- opt-in (by default use all the facts)\r\n- opt-out (by default use the fast strategy, but skip it on demand)",
