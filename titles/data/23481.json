    "body": "Added the checksum for versions 4.1.2 and 4.2.0\r\n\r\nThe `parallel` variant  did the exact same behavior as the `mpi` variant, but they had different default values than each other.  Both variants set the value of `-DCGNS_ENABLE_PARALLEL`, so it was unclear which variant was \"winning\" and could definitely result in a non-intuitive build.   Did a grep of the spack packages and none of them where using the `parallel` variant to control the cgns options.  Retained the `mpi` variant as that one is being used by multiple packages.\r\n\r\nOne issue that remains to be solved is that the default integer size has changed from 32-bit to 64-bit for the 4.2.0 release.  This is controlled by the `int64` variant which currently defaults to `OFF`.  There should maybe be some thought about changing the default to match the default of the current release, or maybe having a version-specific default...  For now, left the behavior as it has been for previous versions.",
