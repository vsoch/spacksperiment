    "body": "This PR adds a config option that allows concretization to match to compilers that are not already available, and changes the install logic to build the compiler and add it to the configuration at install time of the package building against that compiler.\r\n\r\nThe option is controlled by the `install_missing_compilers` boolean flag in the `config.yaml` configuration file.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if no compiler `gcc@7.3.0` is available on the system, `spack install zlib%gcc@7.3.0` will raise a concretization error. With this PR and when the option is turned on, `spack install zlib%gcc@7.3.0` will build gcc and all its dependencies (with a default compiler) before building zlib against that gcc install.",
