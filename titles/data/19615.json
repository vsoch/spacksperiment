    "body": "#18803 forced ghostscript to be built even when graphviz was specified with `~ghostscript`. This caused a huge number of packages to be required when not really needed. I've removed the `ghostscript` requirement and it builds fine. The second part of that PR was to add `groff` as a build requirement, and it does indeed appear that the `graphviz` configure script looks for `groff`, though I can't verify that it breaks without it. I've therefore left in the `groff` requirement, but since it's a commonly distributed binary and build-only dependency, I've added `spack find external` support for `groff`.\r\n\r\nI suggest @joequant add a `conflicts('~ghostscript', when='....')` for whatever system/circumstance failed to build without a spack-installed ghostscript.",
