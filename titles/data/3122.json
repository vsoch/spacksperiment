    "body": "Not intending for this to be merged yet until reviewed and fully tested but this PR does a couple of things.\r\n\r\n1. Appends a major version number to the CNL os version in addition to making CNL lowercase.\r\n- Recently found out that the compute node linux os version is found by the version given by PrgEnv-X. This is how Cray displays their os version to NERSC, not sure if this is the same across all Crays.\r\n\r\n2. unset CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\n- Unless someone tells me this is a bad idea, this should unset CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\r\n\r\n3. Adds a dummy package for Cray-libsci (provides lapack, blas and scalapack)\r\n- Used so that Spack is aware that a cray-libsci package exists.\r\n\r\nSomething I forgot to do is unload cray-libsci in the build-environment prior to building. This could potentially cause issues if a user on a Cray machine wishes to link with MKL or any other lapack, blas, scalapack provider due to the -L statement to cray-libsci found by default in the cray compiler wrappers.",
