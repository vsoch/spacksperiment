    "body": "This PR introduces all of the dependencies required to work with Google's [Flutter](http://flutter.io/) tooling. Most of this is porting/updating of the existing recipes on Homebrew, but pointing to the correct Git repositories and so on (fun fact: Homebrew uses the name \"usbmuxd\" when it actually means \"libusbmuxd\").\r\n\r\nI installed all of these packages via `spack` and was able to use Flutter correctly, so I assume all is well. There's an oddity in `ideviceinstaller` though, in that `1.1.0` does not build on my machine. I think this is actually a bug in the code rather than the spec though because `@master` is fine.\r\n\r\nIf someone could guide me on the correct time to use `type='build'`, I think there might be a few candidates in here. I think the `pkg-config` dependencies can be `build`, as well as all of those utilities using `when='@master'`. If this makes sense to whoever reviews this, I can change that up - I'm just not sure currently. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of packages here, so I can re-target them as individual PRs if needed. I wasn't sure how to structure this PR because there's dependency between the packages so I wanted to avoid being blocked on PRs being merged to add future packages. ",
