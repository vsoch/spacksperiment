    "body": "Fixes #3632.\r\n\r\nThe default `scalapack` provider is `intel-mkl`, which cannot be downloaded from a URL. Even if it could, many users won't have a license for `intel-mkl`. This PR changes the default to `netlib-scalapack`.\r\n\r\nI noticed several other virtual dependencies for which a default was not set. Many of these were for other Intel products like daal and ipp, which cannot be downloaded from a URL. I made sure that every virtual package can now be downloaded. I also set the default for every provider so that it is more deterministic.\r\n\r\n`daal` and `ipp` were both the name of a package and the name of a virtual package. I have no idea how this behaves. I decided to rename these package to `intel-daal` and `intel-ipp` just like `intel-mkl`, and added the virtual dependencies. The default is `intel-parallel-studio` because it can actually be downloaded from a URL.\r\n\r\nThere are probably URLs for other Intel products. We should add these to the packages someday. For now, I only use `intel-parallel-studio`, so the problem doesn't affect me.",
