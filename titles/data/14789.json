    "body": "It looks like it is better to keep the flags coming from the `spec` in the list of injected flags - as it is done by default.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not fix the bug that `pic` flag are not passed to `fc` but only to `f77`. But that is solved with #14788. However, at least the problem with NAG's `fflags: -mismatch` that come from `compilers.yaml` is fixed with this PR, even without the #14788.\r\n\r\nUPD:\r\nIt turns out that `libnetcdff.so` is not usable when compiled with NAG: https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-fortran/pull/221\r\n\r\nWhich is why I added the following:\r\n1. The official Unidata server does not have older versions of netcdf-fortran, therefore the `url` in the package is switched to the same one used in `netcdf-c`.\r\n2. New variant `~shared` with respective changes to `libs`, `configure_args`, and `conflicts`.\r\n3. Run `make check` serially for versions `4.4.5` and older.\r\n4. Several patches that enable building with NAG.\r\n5. A patch for version 4.4.5 fixing a problem with linking to system's `libcurl`.\r\n6. A patch fixing a problem with missing logging symbols in the library.",
