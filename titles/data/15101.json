This script references the Spack-installed instance of Python. When `stat` is relocated to a view, this script needs to be updated to use the Python which was relocated to the view.\r\n\r\nTODOs\r\n\r\n- [ ] refactor this logic into a module that other packages can use if they happen to create python scripts",
