    "body": "This feature would allow package maintainers to add a `warning='...'` attribute in `version()` and `variant()` statements, for example to indicate that a variant or version is deprecated and will be removed in the future, or is not recommended in production, etc. The presence of such a statement would make spack display the warning in red when installing the package with the specified variant/version.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nversion('1.0rc1', warning='This version will be removed when 1.0 comes out')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, or in addition to the above, one could imagine a `warning()` statement with a `when` attribute. This would allow to express warnings related to a full spec.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nwarning(when='@1.5+somefeature%gcc@4.9', 'In version 1.5, feature somefeature is very slow when compiled with gcc 4.9')\r\n```",
