    "body": "The original ftgl project on sourceforge [has been unmaintained since 2011](https://sourceforge.net/p/ftgl/code/HEAD/tree/), and [its last release is the 2.1.3-rc5 release candidate from 2008](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ftgl/files/FTGL%20Source/). This leaves most packages, including Spack's, in the uncomfortable situation where all they can rely on is an RC that was never finished.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, downloading that RC is broken with the latest version of Spack, because Spack has issues translating the \"2.1.3-rc5\" version identifier into a download URL that ends with `FTGL Source/2.1.3~rc5/ftgl-2.1.3-rc5.tar.gz/download` (notice the `~` vs `-` inconsistency).\r\n\r\nAll hope is not lost, however, as some developers who were unsatisfied with the ftgl maintenance situation started maintaining forks of the project on GitHub. From a quick search, the most actively updated of these forks is [the one from frankheckenbach](https://github.com/frankheckenbach/ftgl), which also follows the good practice of tagging proper releases from time to time.\r\n\r\nThis PR therefore proposes enabling that fork and the releases that it has published as a supplementary download source for Spack's ftgl package.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere are some other things which we could do, but which I didn't integrate in this PR as I suspected that it might cause some unnecessary controversy:\r\n\r\n- Remove the `2.1.3-rc5` ftgl release, as its download URL generation is broken on latest Spack and probably not worth fixing.\r\n    * A less brutal alternative would be to manually specify the proper download url as an `url=` version parameter, if `version()` allows for that.\r\n- Remove all old ftgl releases and switch to the CMakePackage recipe. However, if we do this, I suspect we're going to hit the https://github.com/frankheckenbach/ftgl/issues/8 bug. So let's not fix what isn't broken yet?",
