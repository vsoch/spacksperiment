Like I think `gcc@4.8.5` is the first fully c++11 capable version, but I was wondering if there was some special way of encoding this more generically in Spack so that it doesn't need to be enumerated for *every* compiler / toolchain.  It's kind of related to #7612 but I don't think it's as explicit.\r\n\r\nI can PR something if there is an official approach here :smile:",
