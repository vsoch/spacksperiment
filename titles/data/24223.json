    "body": "This issue is meant to track upcoming changes to Spack that are likely to impact users.  We'll put links to issues here that will either break existing workflows or cause major disruptions when you pull from `develop`.\r\n\r\n`develop` is the main development branch of Spack, but many users like to stay at the bleeding edge, and this is intended to provide advance warning for those users. Note that we still recommend using either a [release](https://github.com/spack/spack/#releases) ([more here](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide.html#releases))or a fixed commit from `develop` for production/large site deployments.\r\n\r\nHigh-impact changes for [Spack v0.17](https://github.com/spack/spack/projects/35):\r\n\r\n* #22845: This PR changes the `spec.yaml` format that Spack uses for hashes to `spec.json`. We're doing this for performance -- YAML is too slow for large operations, like reindexing the Spack database or creating indexes for large build caches. We expect this to speed up Spack in many ways, but it will cause the hashing algorithm to change.\r\n* https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/21683: this PR allows a given spec to depend on multiple instances of the same package, differentiated by dependency type; recording the dependency type will change the underlying storage representation\r\n* Python 2.6 will be deprecated in Spack v0.17.0. (It will not be removed until the next major release.)",
