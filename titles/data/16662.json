    "body": "This adds a new `mark` command that can be used to mark packages as either explicitly or implicitly installed. Apart from fixing the package database after installing a dependency manually, it can be used to implement upgrade workflows as outlined in #13385.\r\n\r\nThe following commands demonstrate how the `mark` and `gc` commands can be used to only keep the current version of a package installed:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install pkgA\r\n$ spack install pkgB\r\n$ git pull # Imagine new versions for pkgA and/or pkgB are introduced\r\n$ spack mark -i -a\r\n$ spack install pkgA\r\n$ spack install pkgB\r\n$ spack gc\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there is no new version for a package, `install` will simply mark it as explicitly installed and `gc` will not remove it.\r\n\r\nFixes #9626",
