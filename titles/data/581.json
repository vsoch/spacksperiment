    "body": "The command `set -u` in Bash makes it an error to access an undefined variable. I find this useful, and use it often in my scripts to catch typos. By default, undefined variables are assumed to be empty.\n\nSince `setup-env.sh` needs to be sourced, it inherits the `-u` option. This patch makes `setup-env.sh` succeed in `-u` mode, by explicitly using the empty string if a variable is unset.\n",
