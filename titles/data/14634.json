The only downside is that bash tab completion doesn't support aliases. This PR adds `spack2` and `spack3` executables so that tab completion will work properly.\r\n\r\nP.S. This PR definitely isn't required, if you don't want to merge it because it makes our `bin` directory more complicated, that's perfectly fine, feel free to close it.",
