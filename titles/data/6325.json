Also [spack.package](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spack.html#spack.package.PackageBase.version) seems to skip exactly that method in the doc strings.\r\n\r\nIs there a `version('local', 'file://~/src/myPackage')` syntax? (this fails)\r\n\r\nI would actually like to fetch from such an URI for development :)",
