    "body": "This one is kind of a mess. By default it builds the entirety of the ncbi toolkit and then statically links as much as it can. I've tried to minimize this by explicitly disabling as much as possible, but it still builds a bunch of static libraries which it then statically links into the resulting executables. The libraries are not necessary so I don't install them. I didn't want to change behavior for previous versions hence the version checking stuff in install and configure_args, which I think is correct.",
