    "body": "Two things:\n1. @mpbelhorn and I found that some Cray systems expect `$HOME` to be defined for a \"clean\" environment, otherwise modulecmd throws errors and Spack can't get a default module list.\n2. More interestingly, the CNL operating system class has been looking for modulefiles in `$PATH` instead of `$MODULEPATH`. I think this may have been done for consistency with the compiler discovery patterns in other operating systems, but since there are no modulefiles in `$PATH` on any of the Cray systems that I can access, I think it may be more suitable to rely on `$MODULEPATH`.\n\nTo verify, run `./bin/spack compiler find` in develop with an empty compilers.yaml. You should see that it fails to find any compilers for the CNL operating system. Repeat with this branch, and your cup should runneth over with CNL compilers.\n\nTested successfully on Titan, Gaea C3, Cori, and BlueWaters.\n",
