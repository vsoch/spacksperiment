    "body": "I'm creating a separate issue for this request that was previously discussed at https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/2215#issuecomment-346464285 with @alalazo.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple Python packages available in Spack (_python_, _miniconda2_, _miniconda3_); an Anaconda package has been requested (#2738, #2741), and some of the alternative interpreters (e.g. Jython, PyPy) might also be packaged at some point (even though they only support a subset of Python libraries). Since all these packages provide a Python interpreter and libraries, there should logically be a `Python` virtual package and the existing `Python` package should be renamed to `CPython`.\r\n\r\nThis has two advantages:\r\n- Python can be used in lmod hierarchies. (This is why we discussed it in #2215).\r\n- Python libraries (e.g. _py-numpy_) can now be installed for one of the other providers.\r\n\r\n@citibeth voiced her concerns about making such a change as the `Python` package is a bit special and the change might break other things. ~However, with #7955 this might become easier to implement.~\r\n\r\nI already tried to implement this change, but ran into some issues (https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/2215#issuecomment-349661611). @alalazo also wanted to give it a try.",
