If the `package.py` specifies a url, it'll look for an appropriately named tarball there, but proceeds anyway if it cannot find one, which is expected behavior (I believe). However, if there is no url to try, it fails as seen above. \r\n\r\nThe problem can be worked around by adding a fake url to the `package.py`. It only affects `spack setup` -- `spack install` works fine (because there one uses a valid version).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nSummit or Ubuntu 18.04\r\n\r\n",
