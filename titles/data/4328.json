If you have a copy in a local mirror, you'll need to rename it.\r\n\r\nTwo changes:\r\n\r\n- It seems that Illumina version numbers are dotted and that the\r\n  dashed version in the 2.18... filename is an anomaly (based on the\r\n  names for 2.17.1.14 and 2.19.0).  `url_for_version` does the right\r\n  thing for 2.18.  It will need to be fixed when support for 2.19 is\r\n  added.  2.17 is no longer generally available so it gets a pass.\r\n\r\n- Add version and hash for 2.17.1.14.\r\n\r\n  2.17.1.14 is no longer distributed.  If you have a copy of the\r\n  source tarball, you can drop it into a local mirror w/ the name\r\n  mirror/bcl2fastq2/bcl2fastq2-2.17.1.14.zip and go from there.\r\n\r\n",
