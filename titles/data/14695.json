    "body": "I would like `spack gc` to have the additional functionality that would allow it to uninstall all packages that are not currently activated by some environment.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nI use Spack as a replacement for Homebrew. I would like functionality similar to `brew cleanup` that would allow me to uninstall all old versions of software that are no longer used by my environment. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPreferably, this wouldn't include build dependencies needed to install my environment, since I will need to reinstall the environment from time-to-time, and since Spack currently automatically installs build dependencies even when they aren't needed (#7695).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, @becker33 came up with the following script that could likely be adapted to work for `spack gc`:\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env spack-python\r\nfrom spack.cmd.uninstall import dependent_environments\r\nimport spack.store\r\ninstalled = spack.store.db.query()\r\nfor spec in installed:\r\n    if not dependent_environments([spec]):\r\n        spec.package.do_uninstall()\r\n```\r\n\r\n@alalazo ",
