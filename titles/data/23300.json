    "body": "When trying to set up a mirror, URLPatches containing special characters can fail in surprising ways. For instance:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack mirror add local file://$PWD/mirror\r\n$ mkdir mirror\r\n$ spack mirror create -d mirror autoconf@2.70\r\n==> Adding package autoconf@2.70 to mirror\r\n[...]\r\n==> Fetching file://$SPACK/mirror/autoconf/?id=05972f49ee632cd98057a3caf82ebfb9574846da-eaa3f69\r\n\r\n==> Warning: Error while fetching autoconf@2.70\r\n  sha256 checksum failed for $STAGE/spack-stage-elc1z7pd/?id=05972f49ee632cd98057a3caf82ebfb9574846da\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to be due to `os.path.basename` returning `?id=05972f49ee632cd98057a3caf82ebfb9574846da` for the patch name. curl then returns that the patch already exists because the directory does indeed exist (and the part after `?` is interpreted as a query parameter). This causes Spack to try to fetch the non-existing file.",
