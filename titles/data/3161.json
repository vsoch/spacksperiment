Some packages like `spectrum-mpi` cannot be downloaded at all, and are placeholder packages for system installations. Previously, `__init__()` in `PackageBase` crashed if a package did not have a `url` attribute defined.\r\n\r\nI hacked this section of code out, but I have no idea what the repercussions of that are. Personally, I don't know why we would want to call `url_for_version` during package creation at all. This change probably breaks something, so let me know if you can think of anything that required this.\r\n\r\n@tgamblin @citibeth ",
