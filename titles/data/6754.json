    "body": "I have to use spack on a system with restricted access to the internet.  Having a local mirror is absolutely essential.  However, there are some packages that are defined as only available via git download; tcoffee is one of these.  However, when a md5sum is added to the definition, spack pulls from the mirror when available.   The only issue is that spack adds a potentially confusing warning message to the log.  For instance:\r\n\r\n==> Installing tcoffee\r\n==> Fetching file://my-mirror-dir/mirror/tcoffee/tcoffee-2017-08-17.tar.gz\r\n######################################################################## 100.0%\r\n==> Warning: Fetching from mirror without a checksum!\r\n  This package is normally checked out from a version control system, but it has been archived on a spack mirror.  This means we cannot know a checksum for the tarball in advance. Be sure that your connection to this mirror is secure!\r\n==> Staging archive: my-working-dir/spack/var/spack/stage/tcoffee-2017-08-17-zu53shzvl4e3fplz5wjtwzrwqqmiuzlg/tcoffee-2017-08-17.tar.gz",
