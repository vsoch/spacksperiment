    "body": "We've done a bit of testing and it seems that at least in Intel v18 Update1 the license.lic format has changed. When we choose to use a \"license_file\" during installation (using the silent.cfg option) and give it a license path for license.lic, we are prompted with a file via spack to input the remote server name, port, etc. This is expected. However, spack adds a bunch of comments to this license file on how to use it. \r\n\r\nPreviously in Intel v17, having these there comments was fine. However, in v18 if there are comments ABOVE the server information, the installation will fail because of an invalid file format. Either removing the comments or adding the below the server line rectifies the problem.\r\n\r\nA few things should help users get around this:\r\n-Add the spack comments in this file below the server information.\r\n-Remove the comments altogether.\r\n-Instruct the user in the comments to do one of these.\r\n\r\n-John",
