    "body": "This pull request addresses the following issues.\r\n\r\n- Licensing is currently missing from the recipe. Assuming that majority of the installations will be on clusters, information about the licence manager server would be required\r\n- Replace url with url_for_version in case subsequent versions are added\r\n- Create .spack dir during installation. This directory may not be created automatically causing installation failure when spack is trying to copy the log file there.\r\n- Symlink wolframscript. Most people running mathematica in the cluster environment would be using wolframscript binary. However, the installer does not symlink it, so full path is required to run it.\r\n- Generate spec.yaml. This file may not be created automatically causing package registration failure.",
