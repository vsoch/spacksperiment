    "body": "For convenience, I'm using the same configuration files for two Macs that run a different MacOS version (one with Sierra, the other with High Sierra, but apart from that they are identical from spack's point of view: same compilers installed, same everything installed). Generated executables are exactly the same on both machines (exactly same compilers -custom build-, exactly same MacOS SDK, and exactly same ${MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET} (ie: 10.12).\r\n\r\nIn fact, spack generates exactly the same `compilers.yaml` file on both machines, with the only difference that in one you see \"sierra\" for the `operating_system` entry, and in the other you see \"highsierra\".\r\n\r\nNow, can I use the same `compilers.yaml` file for both machines? Apparently, `operating_system` will allow only one string, according to the schema. But is there any \"dumb tag\" that will allow both sierra and highsierra, or maybe even all MacOS versions? Or can I disable the `operating_system` entry in some way? If possible to disable, would it have any consequence on built packages?",
