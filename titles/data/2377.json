    "body": "- Added 'dap' and 'cdmremote' variants\r\n  This is based on work in #2324 with the following motivation:\r\n      Turn off DAP support by deafult.  DAP requires curl, which has issues\r\n      with circular dependencies.  For 95% of NetCDF users that do not need\r\n      DAP, turning it off avoides this rats nest of problems.\r\n- Added 'parallel-netcdf' variant\r\n  To support work with parallel-netcdf\r\n- Added 'shared' and 'static' build separation",
