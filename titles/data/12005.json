Many have not been updated to the newest release making them incompatible with R >= 3.6. This commit replaces git-based\r\npackages with tool-generated Spack package recipes with correct\r\ndependencies and descriptions in place.\r\n\r\nThe new packages here have all available versions summed from Bioconductor releases 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.\r\n\r\nThe generated packages do not contain any extra required logic for building the package; this will require manual review and testing.\r\nMost non-git based Bioconductor packages (EG r-genomeinfodbdata) and some other CRAN packages will need to be updated before this is merged.\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on installing each package to find any problems.",
