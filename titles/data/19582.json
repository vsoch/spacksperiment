    "body": "`sbang` now lives at https://github.com/spack/sbang, and it has its own test suite that's more extensive than what's in Spack. We'll leave sbang tests to sbang from now on, and just vendor `bin/sbang` directly. Remaining `sbang` tests have to do with patching files, not with `sbang`'s functionality.\r\n\r\nThis update also fixes a bug with `sbang` and multiple command line arguments that was introduced in #19529. See:\r\n  * https://github.com/spack/sbang/pull/1\r\n  * https://github.com/spack/sbang/pull/2\r\n\r\n- [x] include latest `sbang` from https://github.com/spack/sbang\r\n- [x] remove old `sbang` tests from Spack\r\n- [x] update `COPYRIGHT`",
