    "body": "I would like to provide a generic `operating_system` value in my compiler spec or possibly leave it blank and allow spack to auto-detect it.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/LLNL/serac/blob/917eb8f05b99496e29772e251dc5b4ae8c88dd92/scripts/spack/configs/darwin/compilers.yaml#L8\r\n\r\nThis requires the user to alter this line to `bigsur`, `catalina`, etc.  I could copy and paste the same compiler spec several times but that seems unhelpful.  I am just looking to reduce the duplicate specs I provide Spack.  If there is a better way to handle this that I don't know about, I would appreciate that.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n\r\n* \"auto\" for `operating_system`\r\n* Leave it out completely\r\n* List of options? `[\"bigsur\", \"catalina\"]`",
