However i was not sure why extra linking flags `-lhdf5_hl -lhdf5` are needed, neither [Macports](https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/science/abinit/Portfile) nor [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/blob/master/abinit.rb) add anything `hdf5`-related while building `abinit`.",
