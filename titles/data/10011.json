Using a bot can be  nonetheless an improvement as:\r\n- It labels issues, so that we can keep track of historical information e.g. if some issue has been in the top 10 at some point\r\n- We will develop an habit, as a community, to vote for features or bug fixes we care the most\r\n\r\nN.B. In case we want to merge the PR, this [bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/topissues/) needs to be activated first by an owner of the repository.",
