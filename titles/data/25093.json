Running `spack test run` to do all internal smoke tests resulted in several errors indicating that the spack test for some basic utilities was finding the system executable instead of the one provided by spack. We did not attempt to find any externals in this install of spack.\r\n\r\nThe error takes the form:\r\n\r\n`Executable 'perl' expected in prefix, found in /usr/bin/perl instead`\r\n\r\nPackages that exhibited this testing result were: binutils (for 11 of its internally provided executables), cmake, m4 and perl.",
