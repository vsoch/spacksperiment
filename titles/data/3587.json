    "body": "PythonPackage now builds flat installs instead of egg directories.\r\n\r\n@dhmunro noticed that eggs cause extra filesystem operations and more poking around on `sys.path`, which will cause slowdowns on HPC runs.  Yes, you can use [Spindle](http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/spindle) for that, and we do, but there are other good reasons to use a flat layout instead of eggs:\r\n\r\n1. Spack doesn't need eggs -- it manages its own directories and symlinks extensions into place.\r\n\r\n2. Eggs are deprecated for wheels, and wheels install flat.\r\n\r\n3. We don't *have* to do all the `easy-install.pth` merging (#3569, #3583), though we should still support that for packages that want to override this behavior for some reason.\r\n\r\nWe now supply the --single-version-externally-managed argument to `setup.py install` for setuptools packages and setuptools.",
