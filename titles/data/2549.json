For the time being I am reverting it entirely.\r\n\r\nCommit message:\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of #2292 was to use the frontend compiler to make\r\nbuild dependencies like cmake on HPC platforms. It turns out that\r\nwhile this works in some cases, it did not handle cases where a\r\npackage was a link dependency of the root and of a build dependency\r\n(and could produce incorrect concretizations which would not build).",
