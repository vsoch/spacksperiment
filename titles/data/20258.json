Support pip requirements.txt version comparators and wildcards:\r\n>    - <=,=>, and == already exist.\r\n>    - ==9.2.* => >=9.2,<9.3 (reduce to subproblem)\r\n>    - !=9.2.0 => <9.2.0,>9.2.0 (reduce to subproblem)\r\n>    - imprecise:\r\n>        - <9.2.0 => :9.1.999\r\n>        - >9.2.0 => 9.2.0.0.0.1\r\n>        - **Spack is unable to represent strict inequalities (<,>) without this feature.**\r\n>    - Breakage: none.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Extend the Spec parser to process all of the above new inequality notations.\r\n- Extend the Lexer to allow for more than 2 modes (this is useful setup for any further work on the spec syntax).\r\n- Extend VersionRange a bit to support the notion of \"including the left/right endpoint\", which is used to ensure `__contains__` and `__lt__` still work on the new edge cases.\r\n- Add testing.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n`@:!3` and `@3!:` should let users avoid needing to type out the `.999.999` or `.0.0.0.1` suffixes (which I personally find difficult to maintain and ultimately incorrect).",
