    "body": "* Some support for packages building with OpenFOAM\r\n\r\n- Adjust the wrappers calling the OpenFOAM Allwmake script. Have them\r\n  look for a Allwmake-spack file first, which is assumed to contain\r\n  special adjustments for compiling with spack.\r\n\r\n  This file could be delivered as part of a tarball (which is unlikely)\r\n  or generated on the fly by the spack sub-package as part of its\r\n  patch or configure stage.\r\n\r\nCONFIG: change the default paraview variant for openfoam to be False\r\n\r\n- the different combinations of paraview backends, off-screen etc\r\n  make it difficult to suggest that building with paraview as\r\n  a standard dependency makes much sense.\r\n  Additionally, building paraview with qt can become quite an issue.\r\n  So it makes much more sense to only enable that upon request.\r\n\r\nENH: add a +vtk variant.\r\n\r\n- for VTK with off-screen rendering to be used by the runTimePostProcessing\r\n  function object, which is a fairly simple framework for generating images of\r\n  some OpenFOAM derived objects (eg, sampling planes).\r\n\r\nSPACK spec problem:\r\n\r\n- reflect the flex restriction impose by the scotch dependency within\r\n  the openfoam spec as well, as partial workaround for buggy or annoying\r\n  spec resolution.\r\n\r\nOTHER:\r\n\r\n- updated the backstop foamEtcFile file to include args handling\r\n  as per the OpenFOAM-v1806 updates.",
