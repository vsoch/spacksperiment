It was disabled by default initially.\r\n\r\nMore info here: https://github.com/Unidata/netcdf-c/issues/1010 . It seems NetCDF 4.6.3 enabled relax coords by default and required it from PNetCDF. Then PNetCDF 1.10.0 enabled it by default. So there is a gap in PNetCDF versions where it's disabled by default. Therefore enabling it by default for PNetCDF >= 1.8.0 should be the solution.
