OS descriptors are read incorrectly and get assigned `None` if Spack doesn't know about the particular OS, which is wrong.\n2. Concrete specs that have hashes should compare by hash for `satisfies()`.  This is faster, cheaper, _and_ it avoids cases where a concrete spec might match several non-concrete ones that have supersets of its attributes. \n",
