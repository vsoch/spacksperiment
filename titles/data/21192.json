    "body": "Adds the 6.7 release for package `quantum-espresso`. Since the git tag used to publish this version has a suffix `MaX-Release`, the `url` needs to be explicitly specified for this version.\r\n\r\nFor previous versions there were both tags with and without the `MaX` suffix, but according to information on the mailing list [1] this is the final release for 6.7.\r\n\r\nThe patch https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/commit/cf1fedefc20d39f5cd7551ded700ea4c77ad6e8f.diff which was applied on 6.6 is now included in the release, and is not necessary for this version.\r\n\r\nBesides installing it locally I haven't done any manual testing, is there anything else that should be done?\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.mail-archive.com/users@lists.quantum-espresso.org/msg39828.html\r\n\r\n@naromero77, thanks for maintaining this package.",
