It's certainly an issue with the shebang\r\nfixup, but I can't track down which file(s) are causing the issue. If anyone can give me hints, happy to fix/track down further\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack -d install php\r\n...\r\n==> [2020-03-18-14:08:46.269623, 23586] Warning: Module file already exists : skipping creation\r\nfile : /storage/epp2/epp_software/spack-devel/share/spack/modules/linux-centos7-skylake/php-7.4.4-gcc-9.3.0-wtyw6jf\r\nspec : php@7.4.4%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^autoconf@2.69%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^automake@1.16.1%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^bison@3.4.2%gcc@9.3.0 patches=89aa362716d898edd0b5c6ae4208dc1b6992887774848a09e8021afd676f7d61 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^bzip2@1.0.8%gcc@9.3.0+shared arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^diffutils@3.7%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^findutils@4.6.0%gcc@9.3.0 patches=84b916c0bf8c51b7e7b28417692f0ad3e7030d1f3c248ba77c42ede5c1c5d11e,bd9e4e5cc280f9753ae14956c4e4aa17fe7a210f55dd6c84aa60b12d106d47a2 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^flex@2.6.4%gcc@9.3.0+lex patches=09c22e5c6fef327d3e48eb23f0d610dcd3a35ab9207f12e0f875701c677978d3 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^gettext@0.20.1%gcc@9.3.0+bzip2+curses+git~libunistring+libxml2+tar+xz arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^help2man@1.47.11%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^libiconv@1.16%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^libsigsegv@2.12%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^libtool@2.4.6%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^libxml2@2.9.9%gcc@9.3.0~python arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^m4@1.4.18%gcc@9.3.0 patches=3877ab548f88597ab2327a2230ee048d2d07ace1062efe81fc92e91b7f39cd00,fc9b61654a3ba1a8d6cd78ce087e7c96366c290bc8d2c299f09828d793b853c8 +sigsegv arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^ncurses@6.2%gcc@9.3.0~symlinks+termlib arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^perl@5.16.3%gcc@9.3.0+cpanm patches=0eac10ed90aeb0459ad8851f88081d439a4e41978e586ec743069e8b059370ac +shared+threads arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^pkgconf@1.6.3%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^re2c@1.2.1%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^readline@8.0%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^sqlite@3.30.1%gcc@9.3.0~column_metadata+fts~functions~rtree arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^tar@1.32%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^texinfo@6.5%gcc@9.3.0 patches=12f6edb0c6b270b8c8dba2ce17998c580db01182d871ee32b7b6e4129bd1d23a,1732115f651cff98989cb0215d8f64da5e0f7911ebf0c13b064920f088f2ffe1 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^xz@5.2.4%gcc@9.3.0 arch=linux-centos7-skylake ^zlib@1.2.11%gcc@9.3.0+optimize+pic+shared arch=linux-centos7-skylake\r\n==> [2020-03-18-14:08:46.605448, 23586] WRITE LOCK (spack-stage-php-7.4.4-wtyw6jfmd4h7jwbgg6ujc6asmxlf2roa): /tmp/username/spack-stage/.lock[6107926064061561343:1] [Releasing] \r\n==> [2020-03-18-14:08:46.605571, 23586] WRITE LOCK (spack-stage-php-7.4.4-wtyw6jfmd4h7jwbgg6ujc6asmxlf2roa): /tmp/username/spack-stage/.lock[6107926064061561343:1] [Released at 14:08:46.605551] \r\n==> [2020-03-18-14:08:46.616149, 23523] Error: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xfc in position 1462: invalid start byte\r\n\r\n/storage/epp2/epp_software/spack-devel/lib/spack/spack/build_environment.py:818, in child_process:\r\n        815            tb_string = traceback.format_exc()\r\n        816\r\n        817            #
