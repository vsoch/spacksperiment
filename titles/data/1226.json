Much of this work was taken from #1039, but that PR has been inactive for a while now, so I opened my own.\n\nThe following [Tkinter test instructions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) succeeded for me in both Python 2 and 3:\n#### Python 2\n\n```\n$ python\n>>> import _tkinter\n>>> import Tkinter\n>>> Tkinter._test()\n```\n#### Python 3\n\n```\n$ python3\n>>> import _tkinter\n>>> import tkinter\n>>> tkinter._test()\n```\n\nHowever, the tests only succeeded when I manually set my `TCL_LIBRARY` and `TK_LIBRARY`. If anyone knows a way to RPATH these, let me know.\n",
