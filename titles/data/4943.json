One of the changes is \r\n\r\n> Protect against compilation without any source of high\r\n>        quality entropy enabled, e.g. with CMake build system;\r\n> from https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/R_2_2_2/expat/Changes\r\n\r\nHigh quality source of randomness appear to be the getrandom() call (linux 3.17+) the SYS_getrandom system call (linux 3.17+) or arc4random_buf (bsd or libbsd).\r\n\r\nI apparently have none of the above (CentOS 7 kernel running `3.10.0-327.36.3.el7.x86_64`).\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure what people in my situation (older kernels) are supposed to do.  \r\n\r\nOne solution might be to add a package for [libbsd](https://libbsd.freedesktop.org/wiki/).\r\n\r\nIt seems like [sjackman ran into the same problem](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues/88) with Ubuntu 14.04.  His solution was to depend on `libbsd`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could add a variant that defines `XML_POOR_ENTROPY`.\r\n\r\nI'll look into `libbsd`.\r\n\r\n",
