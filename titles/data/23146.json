Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue.

I updated libsigsegv/package.py to version 2.13 and it builds fine.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2320-5931995364\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.2\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-bigsur-arm64\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6346171/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6346172/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
