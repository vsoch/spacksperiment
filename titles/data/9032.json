They just need to be added to the env vars for the wrappers in build_environment.py.\r\n\r\nnow the problem is what to do with packages that have more than one set of libs like `intel-mkl` with `blas_libs`, `lapack_libs` and `scalapack_libs`? That's actually the primary reason to get away from hard-coding `prefix.lib` in order to avoid surpises in `rpaths` for Intel packages.\r\n\r\nThe problem comes from the fact that at this stage Spack can't know which libs will actually be used inside a given package. Maybe a package needs just `blas` libs or the full set of `blas+lapack+scalapack`. So perhaps a simple solution is for complicated packages always define the total `libs` property. ",
