    "body": "Ah, texlive....  Sigh.\r\n\r\nMany (Murphy's law says that it's actually *every #@%%$! one that I try*) of the texlive mirrors currently have an out of sync tarball for beamer.  This type of problem seems to occur regularly.\r\n\r\nThe texlive install script uses the URL 'http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet' which redirects to a mirror that's close to you (or if you're me, a mirror that's broken...).\r\n\r\nI thought it would be nice to add a variant that allowed one to specify the mirror that one wanted to use, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack install texlive scheme=small repository=http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet/\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I added this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n    variant('repository',\r\n            default='http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/texlive/tlnet',\r\n            description='CTAN mirror to use for download')\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that in place, `spack install` complains about an 'Unexpected token'.  A strategically placed `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` leads me to conclude that it's complaining about the ':'.  I tried a couple of other values and discovered other fun things: e.g. if I change the install method so that it glues the `http://` onto the repository string, I end up with this behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack install texlive repository=\"ctan.math.utah.edu/tex-archive/systems/texlive/tlnet\"\r\n==> Error: tex-archive does not match any installed packages.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of this leads me to believe that I'm misusing the `variant` mechanism.\r\n\r\nIs there a proper way that I can pass in a URL?\r\n\r\nI'm loath to hardcode a particular mirror, but I'm *sooooo* close to doing so....",
