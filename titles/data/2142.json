    "body": "Fixes #590.\n\nThis PR introduces the patch @ThemosTsikas from the NAG Compiler Support Team gave me. I also added some documentation on how to get the NAG compiler working by adding `FFLAGS=-mismatch` and `FCFLAGS=-mismatch`. \n\nI noticed that Spack was missing support for `fcflags` so I added that. @xjrc Can you take a look at this and make sure I didn't break anything? You were the last one to work on compiler flag support.\n\nI'm currently having some trouble compiling OpenMPI, so I wouldn't merge this just yet. For some reason my binutils is acting up. Adding the latest Spack installed version solves that, but I was never having that problem before. Also, I think OpenMPI is trying to pass `-pthread` directly to NAG, when it needs to be wrapped by `-Wl,` so it gets passed to gfortran. I'll take a look and see what I can find.\n",
