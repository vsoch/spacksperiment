    "body": "This used to work fine for me. Now I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchecking whether a simple MPI-IO C program can be linked... yes\r\nchecking whether a simple MPI-IO Fortran program can be linked... no\r\nconfigure: error: unable to link a simple MPI-IO Fortran program\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `config.log` this is because:\r\n```\r\nconftest.f90(3): error #7013: This module file was not generated by any release of this compiler.   [MPI]\r\n          USE mpi\r\n--------------^\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some research, I looked at a log of my previous OpenMPI that created a working HDF5 with Intel (I shortened paths):\r\n```\r\n*** Fortran compiler\r\nchecking whether we are using the GNU Fortran compiler... no      \r\nchecking whether ......../spack/lib/spack/env/intel/ifort accepts -g... yes \r\n```\r\n\r\nMy most recent OpenMPI build shows:\r\n```\r\n*** Fortran compiler\r\nchecking whether we are using the GNU Fortran compiler... yes\r\nchecking whether gfortran accepts -g... yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore something changed since September 13 at least that is causing OpenMPI to use GCC underneath even though I am using `%intel@17.0.2` and then fail at building HDF5. Currently my OpenMPI wrappers do still show Intel underneath after install though:\r\n```\r\n[user@machine bin]$ ./mpif90 --version\r\nifort (IFORT) 17.0.2 20170213\r\nCopyright (C) 1985-2017 Intel Corporation.  All rights reserved.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI do not see anything that changed to the OpenMPI package since then. So I am not sure what is causing this.",
