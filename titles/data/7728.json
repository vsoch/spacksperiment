    "body": "We introduce a new package `postgresql-client` which allows for the installation of only client executables and libraries. It provides virtual packages `postgresql-c`, `postgresql-python`, `postgresql-perl`, `postgresql-tcl` and adds other variants (`lineedit`, `gssapi`) which weren't available in the original postgresql package. The postgresql package itself is updated to inherit from the client package and is therefore upgraded to understand the same variants, *etc.*, as the client. As a side effect this fixes the problems in the original package spec caused by a misspelled override (`configure_arg()` vs `configure_args()`).\r\nWe also introduce a new package `py-psycopg` which `depends_on(postgresql-python)`. It also depends on `postgresql-c` but here appears to be a problem with the current version of spack if a recipe `depends_on()` two virtual packages provided by the same concrete package. Advice is sought on whether this should be reported as an issue or understood as a limitation of the system.",
