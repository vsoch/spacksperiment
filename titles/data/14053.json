Previously, it was necessary to write all revs\r\nindividually for packages with multiple length version numbers (2019\r\nand 2019.1).\r\n\r\nThis fixes the build for the old 2017.* versions.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThanks to @adamjstewart for issue #8957.\r\nThanks to @scheibelp for patch #13989.\r\n\r\nAt this point, it's possible to write the version ranges sensibly,\r\nand all of the old revs should build cleanly.\r\n",
