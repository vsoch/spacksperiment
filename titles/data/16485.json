    "body": "A prefix for Tcl modulefiles allows for easy organization by category, use-case, topic, etc. The prefixes can be added to `modules.yaml` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodules:\r\n  tcl:\r\n    all:\r\n      prefixes:\r\n        'applications': [abinit, quantum-espresso, cp2k, namd, vmd]\r\n        'compilers': [gcc, intel]\r\n        'mpi': \r\n          - openmpi\r\n          - mpich\r\n          - mvapich2\r\n          - intel-mpi\r\n          - mpileaks\r\n        'langs': [perl, python]\r\n        'toolchain': \r\n          - autoconf\r\n          - automake\r\n          - gdbm\r\n          - libsigsegv\r\n          - libtool\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere each prefix key is followed by a list of package names that fall under it. Installed packages that have no prefix specified will simply follow whatever naming convention is currently being used.\r\n\r\nWhile this approach is not \"programmatic\" (unlike the suffixes), most sites will only need to do this once in order to maintain a well organized collection of modulefiles. A package can be specified within several prefixes, and they will be prepended in order of appearance.",
