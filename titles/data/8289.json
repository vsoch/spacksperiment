    "body": "This is a continuation of #8182 (I messed up a git rebase...)\r\n\r\nI've been meaning to do this for years, but kept forgetting.\r\n\r\nSpack has these really useful `install` and `install_tree` commands for copying files and directories to the installation prefix. The only problem is that `install_tree` crashed if the directory you were trying to install to already existed (for example, if you wanted to copy everything in the current directory to `prefix`). See https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/8126/files#r188393176 for an example error message.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the call to `shutil.copytree` with a manual copy of every subdirectory/file. Also replaced dozens of calls to `shutil` and `distutils.dir_util` with `install` and `install_tree`. \r\n\r\nThis PR also adds `copy` and `copy_tree` functions that are functionally equivalent to but semantically different than `install` and `install_tree`. Aside from file permissions, they work the same. `copy` and `copy_tree` should be used to copy or backup files/directories while `install` and `install_tree` should be used to copy files to the installation prefix.\r\n\r\nNote that I didn't test any of these package installations, so a careful review would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nCloses #8529",
