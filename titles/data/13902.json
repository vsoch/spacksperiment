At least on macOS 10.14.2, the version\r\n>  of LibreSSL is too old to build Python's ssl module. While this PR\r\n>  doesn't change the required version of OpenSSL, it does add unit tests to\r\n>  ensure that spack install --test=root ***@***.***:+ssl crashes if the\r\n>  required version of OpenSSL is not found.\r\n\r\nHowever... it looks to me like Python needs OpenSSL for ALL versions, not just `@3.7:`.  Any thoughts on how to resolve this?\r\n\r\nHere's a bit more on the issue in general:\r\nhttps://joshspicer.com/python37-ssl-issue\r\n",
