    "body": "fixes #13357\r\n\r\nThis commit factors all the code that is involved in the validation (schema) and parsing of  environment modifications from configuration files in a single place. \r\n\r\nThe naming discrepancy between module and compiler configuration (`append-path` vs. `append_path`, `prepend-path` vs. `prepend_path`) has been removed by retaining only the underscored form of the commands. This potentially introduces a backward incompatibility in configuration files, but is anyhow expected to have a low impact.\r\n\r\nUnit testing of environment modifications in compilers has been refactored and simplified. Docs have been slightly reworded and updated.",
