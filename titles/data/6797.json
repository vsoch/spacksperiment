    "body": "PSyclone is a Parallelisation System for finite element, finite volume and finite difference codes. It is being developed for the UK Met Office's next generation of weather and climate models, which are intended to scale across millions of processors. The primary role of Psyclone is to provide node-based parallel performance for a target architecture, which may consist of multi/many-core processors, GPGPUs and accelerators in various combinations. Psyclone offers the potential for portable performance without manual changes to code in scientific algorithms or computational kernels.\r\n\r\nThis package depends on py-fparser (please see PR #6794).",
