    "body": "I'm looking to create a `packages.yaml` file specific to CentOS-7.  I noticed that Spack provides platform-specific scopes.  But when I looked at it, it seems that the scope is specific to just `linux`, not `linux-centos7-x86_64`, which is what I'm running.\r\n\r\nI want an OS-specific scope so I can add things specific to my Linux distro; mostly, directing it to use system-supplied libraries for various packages that I don't want to build (on my system).  For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   qt:\r\n        paths:\r\n            qt@4.8.5: /\r\n        version: [4.8.5]\r\n        buildable: False\r\n\r\n    libxaw:\r\n        paths:\r\n            libxaw@1.0.12: /\r\n        version: [1.0.12]\r\n        buildable: False\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMight I suggest a further expansion of scopes, to provide for OS-specific as well as platform-specific scopes?  Now the default hierarchy would look like this on my system:\r\n\r\n1. `defaults`\r\n2. `defaults/linux`\r\n3. `defaults/linux-centos7-x86_64`\r\n4. `site`\r\n5. `site/linux`\r\n6. `site/linux-centos7-x86_64`\r\n7. `user`\r\n8. `user/linux`\r\n9. `user/linux-centos7-x86_64`\r\n",
