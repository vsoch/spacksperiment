    "body": "Currently, `build-env` accepts both a spec and a command on the command line. First, this is very hard to discover as the help output does not mention it at all. Second, having to specify `--` to separate the spec and command is not very convenient.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a `-c`/`--command` argument that can be used to specify the build environment command. The only downside is that we have to split the command ourselves using `shlex`. The command argument is now clearly documented in the help output, though.\r\n\r\nFixes #659 \r\nAlternative to #7743",
