It appears that https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/16221 was merged during this time and introduces new unit tests which don't interact well with the fixes. This will reintroduce all changes from #16003 plus whatever is needed to get those changes working with #16221\r\n\r\nFor now this is just the original changes (and I have marked this WIP). But I think it will be useful to create this thread to track the issue.",
