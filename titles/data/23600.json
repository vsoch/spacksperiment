    "body": "This change removes SuperLU from our Trilinos requirement. By default KLU2 will be used from Trilinos instead which allows us one less dependency.\r\n\r\nWe also simplify the package by removing the `shared` variant which was used to force static builds for Darwin. It appears we only need to build Trilinos with static libraries on Darwin after testing these changes and the option for that was reduced to only Trilinos.\r\n\r\nLastly, we remove the `openmp` variant since after the Xeon Phi was discontinued, we never test with this option, and Shreyas has left the project.",
