This description can be used to replicate the installation on other systems. It can also be used to collect the environment modifications necessary to expose that subset of packages to a user.\r\n\r\nExample commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack env create c2\r\nspack env add c2 openmpi\r\nspack env concretize c2\r\nspack env list c2\r\nspack env relocate c2 --compiler=gcc@4.6.1 # reconcretize, replace previous compiler with gcc@4.6.1\r\nspack env list c2 --include-deps\r\nspack env upgrade c2 libxml2 # upgrade the libxml2 dependency\r\nspack env list-modules c2 # show all modules for all packages in the context\r\n```",
