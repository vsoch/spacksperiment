    "body": "This PR adds 0.18 and removes older versions susceptible to a symlink bug in `ch-tug` and `ch-grow`. From the release notes:\r\n\r\n> This release fixes an important symlink handling bug in ch-tug and ch-grow ([#819](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud/issues/819)). Prior to version 0.18, if a pulled image contained a symlink in one layer and then a regular file at the same path in a subsequent layer, the target of the symlink would be overwritten even if it was not within the image; i.e., unpacking inappropriately followed the symlink. This allows a crafted image to overwrite any file writeable by the invoking user.\r\n>\r\n> (The underlying cause is a known bug in Python's tarfile module, e.g. https://bugs.python.org/issue35483, https://bugs.python.org/issue19974.)\r\n",
