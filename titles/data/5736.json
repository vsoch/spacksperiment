    "body": "I recently made the switch to Python 3, and was trying to debug #5727 when I discovered that our documentation doesn't build at all if you're using Python 3. Previously, `make` would crash with:\r\n```\r\n  File \"conf.py\", line 67, in <module>\r\n    stderr=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[1].strip().split('.')\r\nTypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'\r\n```\r\nInstead of running `spack -V` from the command line and screwing around with bytes and strings, I just copied the version directly from `spack.spack_version`.\r\n\r\nP.S. Do we want to add documentation tests for Python 3? I am leaning towards no, as it isn't exactly mission critical.",
