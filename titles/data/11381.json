    "body": "Previous license checks have allowed for significant deviation in the license header as long as a few parts of the license matched the general format.\r\n\r\nThis updates the license check to require almost an exact match, ignoring leading/trailing whitespace, or leading `#`/`.` characters (to account for python/bash and rst files).\r\n\r\nThe check is updated to print a debug message if a date mismatch is detected (e.g. if the copyright ends in 2018 vs. 2019 at this point). A mismatch on the upper end of the date range is not considered an error (so long as it falls within `[2017, 2029]`).\r\n\r\nAs an example of how much stricter this is, `Copyright 2018 Lawrence...` from the `simgrid` package was considered a mismatch, and had to be updated to `Copyright 2013-2019 Lawrence`. This could be relaxed to allow for matching on a single year.\r\n\r\nThe only other package considered noncompliant (which will cause this PR to fail testing) was `aom`, which updates the first line of the license:\r\n\r\n`Copyright 2013-2019 Trinity College Dublin and other Spack Project`",
