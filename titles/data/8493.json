    "body": "I have found that if NetCDF is specified as an external, I get concretization errors with `trilinos+pnetcdf`. This is because `parallel-netcdf` is only satisfied as a dependency through `netcdf+parallel-netcdf` when in fact, `parallel-netcdf` is a direct dependency of `trilinos+pnetcdf`. This makes `parallel-netcdf` a direct dependency of Trilinos when `trilinos+pnetcdf`.",
