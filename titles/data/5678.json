    "body": "Currently running `spack gpg list` with no arguments returns nothing. You must supply either the `--trusted` or the `--signing` options. The idea here is to return some initial data to the user when the command is run. The alternative is to return an error, telling the user to select one of the two options.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #5677 ",
