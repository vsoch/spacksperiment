    "body": "It would be nice to have the possibility to use different tarballs for variants of a package. With `url_for_version`, this can be achieved by accessing `self.spec` and branching there, but will fail at the checksum stage. Thus `url_and_checksum_for_spec` would be nice to have.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThis came up when updating the Apache Spark recipe to a later version. We make use of some Hadoop/Hive features from within our Spark code, and ideally would like to rely on the Hadoop+Hive jars shipped with Spark. To retain flexibility, I think it would be nice to download a different tarball when `+hadoop` is specified compared to `~hadoop`, and provide two different checksums.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI considered adding hive as a separate package as well as downloading the required additional, Spark specific Jars from the central Maven repository as additional resources. Given that Spark is provided in binary form, this introduces a branching nightmare considering multiple Spark versions compiled for different Scala version. It would be considerably easier to use different tarballs for different flavors.\r\n",
