    "body": "Fix #505: This adds two properties to `Package`: `sanity_check_files` and `sanity_check_dirs`.  They might look like this for libelf:\n\n``` python\nclass Libelf(Package):\n    ...\n    sanity_check_files = ['include/libelf.h']                                                                                                          \n    sanity_check_dirs  = ['lib']\n```\n\nSpack will check for the existence and type of these files/directories, and if they're not present, or if they're not files (directories), then Spack will fail the build.\n\nThe intent is that you add a few files here that _must_ be present for the install to have succeeded.  This should allow you to write sane builds for ill-behaved packages that write to their install directories before the build is complete.\n",
