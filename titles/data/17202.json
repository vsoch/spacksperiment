    "body": "Bug fix release:\r\n\r\n4.0.4 -- June, 2020\r\n-----------------------\r\n- Fix a memory patcher issue intercepting shmat and shmdt.  This was\r\n  observed on RHEL 8.x ppc64le (see README for more info).\r\n- Fix an illegal access issue caught using gcc's address sanitizer.\r\n  Thanks to  Georg Geiser for reporting.\r\n- Add checks to avoid conflicts with a libevent library shipped with LSF.\r\n- Switch to linking against libevent_core rather than libevent, if present.\r\n- Add improved support for UCX 1.9 and later.\r\n- Fix an ABI compatibility issue with the Fortran 2008 bindings.\r\n  Thanks to Alastair McKinstry for reporting.\r\n- Fix an issue with rpath of /usr/lib64 when building OMPI on\r\n  systems with Lustre.  Thanks to David Shrader for reporting.\r\n- Fix a memory leak occurring with certain MPI RMA operations.\r\n- Fix an issue with ORTE's mapping of MPI processes to resources.\r\n  Thanks to Alex Margolin for reporting and providing a fix.\r\n- Correct a problem with incorrect error codes being returned\r\n  by OMPI MPI_T functions.\r\n- Fix an issue with debugger tools not being able to attach\r\n  to mpirun more than once.  Thanks to Gregory Lee for reporting.\r\n- Fix an issue with the Fortran compiler wrappers when using\r\n  NAG compilers.  Thanks to Peter Brady for reporting.\r\n- Fix an issue with the ORTE ssh based process launcher at scale.\r\n  Thanks to Benjam\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez for reporting.\r\n- Address an issue when using shared MPI I/O operations.  OMPIO will\r\n  now successfully return from the file open statement but will\r\n  raise an error if the file system does not supported shared I/O\r\n  operations.  Thanks to Romain Hild for reporting.\r\n- Fix an issue with MPI_WIN_DETACH.  Thanks to Thomas Naughton for reporting.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Howard Pritchard <howardp@lanl.gov>",
