Copy the message below\r\n2. Fill in the blanks with the emails you used to contribute to Spack.\r\n3. Paste it as a comment on **this** issue.\r\n\r\n**A note on emails:** You **only** need to post emails that appear in the Spack history.  To get these, clone `https://github.com/spack/spack.git` and use `git log` to see what emails you should use.  For example, Todd Gamblin appears in the logs in the following ways:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git\r\n$ cd spack\r\n$ git log --format='\"%an\" %ae' | grep -i Gamblin | sort | uniq\r\n\"George Todd Gamblin\" gamblin2@llnl.gov\r\n\"Todd Gamblin\" gamblin2@llnl.gov\r\n\"Todd Gamblin\" tgamblin@llnl.gov\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may want to search for your name and `<your github username>@noreply.github.com`. We just need enough to associate your consent with your contributions.\r\n\r\nHere is the message text:\r\n> My name is _________________________, and I am a contributor to Spack. I have used or may have used the following email address(es): ______________________________. I consent to change the current license contained in the License file at https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/LICENSE from the LGPL-2.1 license to the MIT License and Apache License 2.0 with respect to all of my contributions to Spack.\r\n\r\nBy granting this permission, you are confirming that you have the right to make your contribution(s) to Spack and to grant this permission, and that if you made your contribution(s) in the course of your employment, that such contributions and consent have been authorized by your employer.",
