    "body": "I am building `mpich @3.3.2` (the latest version) on OS X. This library apparently ships with a version of `hwloc @2.0` included. When I install `mpich`, then its library seems to contain (and make visible to others) the respective `hwloc` symbols. Of course, the `hwloc` include files are not installed.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a conflict if a different version of `hwloc` is installed as well, as (depending on the link order) `mpich`'s `hwloc` symbols are found first. The error I am then seeing is\r\n```\r\nERROR from host Redshift.local process 0\r\n  while executing schedule bin hwloc_startup, routine hwloc::hwloc_version\r\n  in thorn hwloc, file /Users/eschnett/CarpetX/arrangements/ExternalLibraries/hwloc/src/version.c:24:\r\n  -> library version 2.1.0, build-time API version 0x20100, run-time API version 0x20000\r\napplication called MPI_Abort(MPI_COMM_WORLD, 1) - process 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error is generated from a consistency check I implemented for `hwloc`, which compares the version numbers of `hwloc` used to build, and the version found at run time.\r\n\r\nPossible remedies could be:\r\n- Configure `mpich` so that it doesn't export `hwloc` symbols. Maybe they can be renamed at the source level? Or maybe they can be hidden using linker magic?\r\n- Tell `spack` about this, i.e. ensure that `mpich` depends on the same version of `hwloc` that it contains anyway. That would be cheating, but would avoid the error I'm seeing.\r\n- Tell `spack` about this, making it a conflict to use `mpich` and `hwloc` at the same time since they export the same symbols. That's technically correct, but would make `mpich` unusable for me.",
