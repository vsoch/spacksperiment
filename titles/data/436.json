    "body": "This PR is just a sketch for a lightweight implementation of a shared interface among providers of the same type. The focus here is on being less invasive as possible while being able to rely on a set of common calls for providers of the same service (e.g. `mpi`). \n\nThe basic ideas are:\n- use `ABCMeta` to enforce implementation of a common provider interface\n- the provider interface will be used as a mixin at package definition time\n- reduce code duplication providing standard implementations\n\nAs usual any comment or critique is welcome.\n",
