These variants will be given `values=lambda x: True`.\r\n\r\nThis allows for easy open-ended variants\r\n```python\r\nvariant('config_file', default='/etc', description='location of the config file')\r\n```\r\nCan take any input, and will attempt to locate a config file at that location.\r\n\r\nStarted this on the wrong branch, so some extra commits appear in the log. They'll be squashed out anyway.",
