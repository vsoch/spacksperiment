    "body": "I'm trying to build `converge` for a user, and unfortunately it isn't very specific as to which versions of OpenMPI it supports. `converge` is a pre-built licensed binary that comes with executables for each popular MPI library. For example, the newest version looks like:\r\n```\r\n$ ldd -r converge-2.4.10-ompi \r\n\tlibmpi.so.12 => not found\r\n```\r\nI installed the latest version of OpenMPI, but this library comes with:\r\n```\r\n$ ls libmpi.so*\r\nlibmpi.so  libmpi.so.20  libmpi.so.20.10.1\r\n```\r\nOf course, I could add a symlink for `libmpi.so.12`, but there's no guarantee that they are API compatible, so I'd rather not do that.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know where I can find a list of the versions of OpenMPI that provide `libmpi.so.12`? Also, is there any way I can hardcode this in the dependency? Since it's a virtual dependency, I don't think there is a way to do this.",
