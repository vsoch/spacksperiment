    "body": "This commit introduces a mechanism to insure that R package dependencies\nare built with the Spack compiler wrapper. A copy of `Makeconf`, `Makeconf.spack` is made\nbefore `filter_compilers` is called. This is then pointed to by the\n`R_MAKEVARS_SITE` environment variable set up in\n`setup_dependent_environment`. With this, the normal compilers are used\noutside of spack and the spack wrapper compilers are used inside of\nspack.\n\nThis commit also standardizes on the `join_path` call. It also sets the\ncommented build command to reflect what is actually used with the newer\nstring formatting.\n",
