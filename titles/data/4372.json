    "body": "Closes #4358 \r\n\r\nPersonally, I'm not a big fan of adding every version of a package. But I think we should make a special case for MPI packages. In my case, I'm trying to install an older version of `converge`, a licensed software package that comes with pre-built executables. These executables link to `libmpi.so.0`, which goes all the way back to OpenMPI 1.4. I had to add and build every version to find the `libmpi.so` version numbers, so I figured it would be useful to leave them in as comments for anyone who runs into a similar situation.\r\n\r\nA lot of the flags we're using aren't compatible with older versions, as you would expect. But OpenMPI's configure script is pretty chill about it and issues a warning but doesn't crash. I might add more `conflicts()` in the future, but it's not a huge deal.",
