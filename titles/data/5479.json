This additional check unfortunately seems to be required\r\n  for the additional openmpi constraint, since openfoam only directly\r\n  depends_on 'mpi', not on 'openmpi'.\r\n\r\n  Without this runtime check, the user could easily compile and\r\n  install with the incorrect openmpi configuration and experience\r\n  various issues with openfoam.",
