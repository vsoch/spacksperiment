Which is unfortunate as one can't have `intel-mkl threads=none` and `intel-mkl threads=openmp` installed at the same time ;-(\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack install intel-mkl\r\nspack install intel-mkl threads=openmp\r\n```\r\n\r\ngives error during installation and prints the message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe install directory path was changed to <previous-spack-installed-mkl> \r\nbecause at least one software product component was detected as having already been installed on the system\r\n\r\nPlease select at least one component before you continue\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if there is anything Spack can do... ;-(",
