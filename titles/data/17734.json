Oracle JDK 8 can no longer be downloaded automatically, so that makes it problematic in many ways. I have OpenJDK 11.0.7 on my Ubuntu 20.04 instance and it builds Bazel just fine.\r\n\r\nPinging some interested parties: @lee218llnl @healther @coreyjadams @Sinan81 @s-sajid-ali @darmac \r\n\r\nCloses #14058",
