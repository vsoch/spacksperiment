    "body": "* New versions of OpenCV are available\r\n* Removed protobuf dependency since opencv builds its own. Having a dependency on protobuf leads to header mismatch if spack's protobuf is included but opencv has an older version of protobuf\r\n* Cuda conflicts gcc > 7 (`/home/squar/Git/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64/gcc-8.3.0/cuda-10.0.130-4jz6namrc73qrjfik5qevef5jiih73xn/include/crt/host_config.h:129:2: error: #error -- unsupported GNU version! gcc versions later than 7 are not supported!`). By the way, I'm suprised there is nothing inside the cuda package even though cuda is quite picky with compatible compiler versions in general\r\n* Because of other issues, which have nothing to do with openCV itself, some variants/dependencies have to be set. I successfully built openCV with `spack install opencv~cuda^vtk+osmesa@8.0.1^hdf5+hl^python@3:` with gcc@8.3.0 on Ubuntu@18.04",
