    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install -j 64 py-adios ^python@3.0:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is lots of errors like:\r\n```adios_mpi.cpp:47080:21: error: 'PyThreadState' {aka 'struct _ts'} has no member named 'exc_type'; did you mean 'curexc_type'?```\r\n\r\nAnd similar.\r\n\r\n### Platform and user environment\r\n```commandline\r\n$ uname -a\r\nLinux quokka1.ccs.ornl.gov 4.14.0-115.el7a.aarch64 #1 SMP Tue Sep 25 12:32:51 EDT 2018 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\npy-adios includes a file (adios_mpi.cpp) which was generated using Cython 0.28.2.  This version of Cython generates code that won't compile against the Python 3.7 C API.  (This was fixed in the 0.29 release.)  The Adios developers have been notified (https://github.com/ornladios/ADIOS/issues/202).\r\n\r\nI think the workaround is to add a ```depends_on()``` line for python <=3.6.x.  If/when the issue is fixed in Adios, we can add a ```when``` clause to the dependency.  I'll issue a pull request shortly.\r\n",
