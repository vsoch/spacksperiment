    "body": "Added hash values for LBANN v0.101 and Hydrogen v1.5.0.  Updated the\r\nLBANN package to be more successful in resolving a legal configuration\r\nof MPI and HWLOC packages.  This required the removal of the MPI\r\nvirtual package since it is unable to resolve dependencies with\r\nminimum version requirements. As a result to enable a reasonable\r\ninstall line for LBANN this requires explicit forwarding of MPI\r\nvariants to Hydrogen and Aluminum.  Due to the lack of variant\r\nforwarding, there are many explicitly replicated dependencies for both\r\nLBANN and Hydrogen.  Fixed the error in LBANN where gpu variant was\r\nreplaced by the cuda variant, but not all dependencies were fixed.\r\n",
