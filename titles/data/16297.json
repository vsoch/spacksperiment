The full list of dependency updates is as follows:\r\n\r\n- `@3: ^vtk@8.1.0:8.1.999` (see [here](https://github.com/visit-dav/visit/issues/3498))\r\n- `+silo ^silo@4.10+shared` (I got build failures for older versions because of missing ghost interfaces, which were added in [silo@4.10](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/silo/releases/release-notes-4.10))\r\n- `+silo{+|~mpi} ^silo{+|~}mpi` (makes building uniform `mpi` stacks easier)\r\n\r\nI tested that variant `visit@3.0.1~mpi~gui+python+silo+hdf5` installs in build environment `gcc%4.9.3 arch=linux-rhel7-broadwell`.",
