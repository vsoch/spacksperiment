In this way group of executables with common purposes can be grouped under a single name and a simple command can be used to detect all of them. As an example introduce the \"build-tools\" tag to search for common development tools on a system.\r\n\r\nExample of use:\r\n```console\r\n% spack external find -t build-tools\r\n==> The following specs have been detected on this system and added to /Users/culpo/.spack/packages.yaml\r\nautoconf@2.69  automake@1.16.2  cmake@3.19.1  flex@2.5.35  gmake@3.81  libtool@2.4.6  m4@1.4.6  pkgconf@1.7.3\r\n```",
