    "body": "Building emacs on darwin throws an error when trying to build an Emacs\r\napp in the `nextstep/Emacs.app` path of the build tree. For now, disable\r\nbuilding this app.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to enable building the app also; Homebrew offers options\r\nto this effect, and also adds Mac-specific options for starting the\r\nemacs daemon. However, for the sake of simplicity and getting a\r\nworkable up-to-date emacs installation on my machine as quickly as\r\npossible, this commit focuses on a minimal viable modification.",
