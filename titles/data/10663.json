    "body": "Previously, the `curl` build was picking up a system dependency that dependend on the system `openssl`.  Thus, both the system and Spack `openssl` were included in the build, which caused it to fail in weird ways.  This problem was not caught on most systems because the Spack and system `openssl` are similar (enough) versions.  But I'm building on an old system with a really old system `openssl`, making the bug apparent.\r\n\r\nThe solution was to go through the dependency list, add more variants where appropriate, and explicitly turn off dependencies we don't use.",
