    "body": "AXL now has a new release, v0.4.0.\r\n\r\nThis deprecates the older versions as, since AXL has changed a lot since its last release, it was decided to get users onto the new version because support won't be maintained for previous ones. Current users had already been informed to use the main branch up to this point, rather than a previous release.\r\nThis allows for dropping the `async_api` variant and related function, as the options it provided are now being removed or\r\nautomated and it is now useless in its current state.\r\n\r\nAdds a new variant for customizing AXL to error or fallback to an alternate async method when on a system using BBAPI.",
