    "body": "fixes #15848\r\n\r\nThe idea of the how-to part of the docs is to provide short and clear examples to specific problems that a user may want to solve with Spack. It assumes the user to be already familiar with Spack terminology, to keep each how-to short, but ideally provides a lot of links to reference documentation for people who need to dig deeper in a topic.\r\n\r\nEach how-to item has the following structure:\r\n\r\n1. **Problem:** Brief statement of the use case that is going to be solved.\r\n2. **Solution:** Walkthrough for the current problem. \r\n3. **Discussion:** Comments on the caveats of the solution being proposed\r\n\r\nAn example of the current layout is:\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-11-20 13-59-11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4199709/99803390-aa95b400-2b39-11eb-8989-ca81bc7c2c41.png)\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add some content to the how to part (mainly grabbed from the \"Workflows\" section under \"Basics\")\r\n- [ ] Move the entire Workflows section under \"How to\" (is there consensus on this?)\r\n- [ ] Add content for the issues linked in #15848",
