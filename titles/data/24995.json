    "body": "By default, Spack installs the latest stable release of a package. I would like a concretizer option that allows me to install the oldest release that Spack knows about for each package in an environment.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nI would like to use Spack for CI. Instead of only testing the latest release of my dependencies, I would like to also test the oldest version of these dependencies that I support.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n@tgamblin and I talked a couple years back about how with the new concretizer it would be easy to have custom concretization features. For example, minimize dependencies, maximize variants, minimize rebuilds, etc. This would be another option that would install the oldest version of packages possible.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nAn equivalent feature for pip has been proposed here: https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8085",
