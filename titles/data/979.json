Just downloading the good file.\n\nI also remove the call of configure from install to follow a remark of @tgamblin  in #231 \n\n@xjrc : I tried to compile the version 5.1.10b and 6.0.0 with +esmumps/~esmumps and +mpi/~mpi\nplus some version with +metis/~metis, and did not get any trouble. Can you check if it still works for you.\n",
