The workaround for this is to uninstall the package globally, then reinstall it within the environment.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nThis is accurate as of spack version 0.14.2.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
