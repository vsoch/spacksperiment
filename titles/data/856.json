There have been a number of improvements since the 4.4.0 release. Most importantly, this release candidate is able to write backwards-compatible netCDF4 files when using HDF5 version 1.10.0. As announced previously, using HDF5 1.10.0 with netCDF 4.4.0 would result in netCDF4 files which were unreadable by systems using an earlier version of libhdf5. See GitHub #250 for more information.\n\nWould it be OK to temporarily comment out version hdf5@1.10.0 until the NetCDF issue is sorted out?\n",
