    "body": "I found that go-bootstrap/go package cannot support aarch64 now.\r\n\r\nIf we want to support aarch64 , the flow is like that:\r\n\r\n> 1)  Download the 1'st arm64 version as below:\r\n> https://dl.google.com/go/go1.8.7.linux-arm64.tar.gz\r\n>\r\n> 2) unpack `go1.8.7.linux-arm64.tar.gz`\r\n>\r\n> 3) export `GO_BOOTSTRAP=/xxx/go` \r\n>\r\n> 4) After finishing above steps, the latest go package can be download and compile.\r\n\r\nBut the question is that: I think it's totally deferent way of x86 bootstrap compare for the above steaps.\r\nSo I'm not sure how to modify the go-bootstrap package.py.\r\n\r\nIs there any suggestion for developing this patch?",
