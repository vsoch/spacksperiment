    "body": "Fixes #13346.\r\n\r\nFor `spack module loads` and `spack module find`, allow missing upstream modules (print a debug message vs. raising an error); also skip local modules if they are blacklisted.\r\n\r\nOld behavior:\r\n\r\n* `spack module find` will report an error if the root spec's module or any dependency module does not exist (regardless of whether it is blacklisted)\r\n* `spack module loads` works the same\r\n\r\nNew behavior: the short version is that the module finding is now more lenient (especially for blacklisted modules):\r\n\r\n* `spack module find` will report an error if the root spec's module does not exist, unless\r\n  * the module for the spec is blacklisted\r\n    * For the root package, a debug message is output so that the user could check this with `spack -d...`\r\n    * For any dependency package (when requesting dependency modules with `spack module find`) a message will not be reported (it's an error if the module is not blacklisted, but if it is blacklisted, the module is silently skipped)\r\n  * the spec is associated with an upstream\r\n    * instead of throwing exceptions when the module isn't find, the logic now prints out a debug-level message so the user has a hint of what is missing if they were expecting to see a module file for an upstream package\r\n* `spack module loads` works exactly the same way as the new `spack module find`, but informational messages are not generated for blacklisted packages ",
