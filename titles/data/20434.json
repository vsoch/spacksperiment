I simply want to report the deprecation warning.**\r\n\r\nI wrote a spack-python script to do some cleanup/setup of spack files in between runs.

test:\r\n```\r\nimport unittest\r\nfrom .cleanup import spack_compiler_find\r\nimport os\r\nimport shutil\r\n\r\nclass test_SpackCleanup(unittest.TestCase):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def setUpClass(cls):\r\n        if not os.path.isdir(os.path.expanduser('~/.spack')):\r\n            os.mkdir(os.path.expanduser('~/.spack'))\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def tearDownClass(cls):\r\n        if os.path.isdir(os.path.expanduser('~/.spack')):\r\n            shutil.rmtree(os.path.expanduser('~/.spack'))\r\n\r\n    def test_compiler_find(self):\r\n        spack_compiler_find()\r\n

information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output (Not Applicable)\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
