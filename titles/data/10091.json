    "body": "Inspired by #10078: \r\n\r\nThere are at least 2 reasons why checksums of sources change:\r\n1) Upstream authors violate the convention of a release being final and change sources in place (#10078)\r\n2) Malicious people change the sources\r\n3) The sources become corrupted\r\n\r\nThe idea behind checksum checking is to guard against 2), but gets in the way of 1). In case we have to update checksums in place, all mirroring/caching that spack is doing is getting in the way. \r\n\r\nMy question would now be: Would it be better to allow `version` to implement the same \"identifier\" multiple times?\r\nThat would represent the real world situation that people don't treat versions as sacrosanct and const. There was recently a question or a PR asking how to implement different sources for different arches, that extended `version`s (unfortunately I can't find it anymore), so we will probably have to at least somewhat extend `version` anyway\r\n\r\nAnticipated problems:\r\n- \"Weakens\" identification, it's only needed to fake one entry\r\n- How to define the \"correct\" checksum\r\n- How to report this to the user (i.e. for reproducibility)",
