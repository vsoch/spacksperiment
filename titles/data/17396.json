    "body": "When using the cuda build system, the maintainers are passed through to the package in the output of `spack info`. This began with ~~#15301~~ #15031, but that is probably only because that PR added the `maintainers` field to the cuda build system. The cuda build system lists the following maintainers:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git grep maintainers lib/spack/spack/build_systems/\r\nlib/spack/spack/build_systems/cuda.py:    maintainers = ['ax3l', 'svenevs']\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using the cuda build system, such as in a mixin, those are propagated.\r\n```console\r\n$ spack info gpu-burn | grep Maintainers\r\nMaintainers: @ax3l @svenevs\r\n```\r\neven though no maintainers are listed in the gpu-burn package.",
