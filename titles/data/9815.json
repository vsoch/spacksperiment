    "body": "Unit tests with Python 2.6 started failing regularly on Travis since November 8th. See also #9776 \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nRecently, any PR will fail the python 2.6 unit tests. The last time python 2.6 tests worked seems [this one](https://travis-ci.org/spack/spack/builds/452605915), while one of the first failures happened [on a previous build](https://travis-ci.org/spack/spack/builds/452293621) with the same commit hash. This suggests the failures are not due to bugs that sneaked in with new features or recent merges.\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nWhat can be seen is that Spack hangs when trying to concretize `mpileaks`:\r\n```console\r\n...\r\nmore help:\r\n  spack help --all       list all commands and options\r\n  spack help <command>   help on a specific command\r\n  spack help --spec      help on the spec syntax\r\n  spack docs             open http://spack.rtfd.io/ in a browser\r\nInput spec\r\n--------------------------------\r\nmpileaks%gcc\r\n    ^elfutils@0.170\r\nConcretized\r\n--------------------------------\r\nNo output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.\r\nCheck the details on how to adjust your build configuration on: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#Build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received\r\nThe build has been terminated\r\n...\r\n```\r\n",
