    "body": "this is meant to prevent delayed compiler errors for packages which need MPI/Blas/Lapack with Fortran whereas specific implementations are build without Fortran.\n\nAt some point one would need to add an option `+fortran` for virtual packages (mpi, blas, lapack) and propagate it to particular implementations (`openmpi`, `openblas`, `mpich`, etc). Then ifs will change to `if (self.compiler.f77 is None) and ('+fortran' in spec):`. In other words, one would still need those ifs to throw an error.\n",
