    "body": "The main reason I opened this PR is because:\n\n```\nfrom spack import *\n\nclass ${class_name}(Package):\n```\n\ncauses flake8 to be unhappy. I made it two empty lines.\n\nWhile I was at it, I also changed:\n\n``` python\nconfigure('--prefix=%s' % prefix)\n```\n\nto\n\n``` python\nconfigure('--prefix={0}'.format(prefix))\n```\n\nWhile the former only works in Python 2, the latter works in Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3. The sooner we include this in the template, the sooner we can get people used to using it. Then, converting Spack to Python 3 (hopefully in the distant future) will be a little bit easier.\n\nLet me know if you don't want to include the latter.\n",
