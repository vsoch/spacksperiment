The [fallback solution](https://www.gfd-dennou.org/arch/netcdf/unidata-mirror/) that we used doesn't offer old versions anymore too. Hence, it's time to finally switch to GitHub. Unfortunately, the tarballs that are available there have slightly different contents, which is why we need to update the checksums too. I am going to show the difference in the following comments.\r\n\r\nCloses #15752",
