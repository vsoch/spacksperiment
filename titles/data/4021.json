    "body": "The `llnl.util` package currently in Spack was intended to be general Python stuff for Spack and other LLNL projects, but it isn't used that way.  Some of it is used by [LLNL/cram](https://github.com/LLNL/cram), but the codebases are maintained independently, and the code in Spack has moved on quite a bit from what's in `cram`.\r\n\r\nThere are some things in there, like `llnl.util.lock`, `tty.colify` (I'm not aware of another Python colifier that does variable-width columns), `tty.color`, and `tty.log` that could probably be factored out of Spack one day, but right now, for all intents and purposes, they're in Spack.  I think it would make things clearer if we moved them to `spack.util`.\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart @alalazo: thoughts?",
