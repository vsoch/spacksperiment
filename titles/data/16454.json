    "body": "The current `include` feature of environments only supports including configs.\r\nPlease make it possible, so that the referenced files could provide `definitions` (or other features of `spack.yaml`).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWe have a bunch of environment which share a lot of common parts. Maintainaing the common parts is always a repetitive task. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe already consider using some extra tool to create the environment files from some sort of templates. But really, spack already has the definitions and include features, they just don't cooperate with each other.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI filed this issue after talk with @becker33.\r\n\r\n#10582 references includes as well and possibly should be looked at.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n  current develop branch\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
