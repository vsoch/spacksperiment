I got lucky -- they were already in spack.\r\n\r\nNow I'm hitting this:\r\n```\r\n     172    checking for poptConfigFileToString in -lpopt... no\r\n  >> 173    configure: error: You need popt 1.7 or newer to compile.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`popt` appears to be a command-line parser.  \r\n* Is this its real home page?  https://openwrt.org/packages/pkgdata/libpopt \r\n* Or this?  https://launchpad.net/popt   \r\n\r\nSeems like a multiply forked codebase, perhaps?   @hartzell is there a way to resolve this, without asking the cryptsetup folks directly?\r\n\r\nEdit: updated PR references for popt and singularity 3.4.0",
