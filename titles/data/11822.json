    "body": "I built a Python stack in a Spack Environment with view.  Then the command\r\n```\r\n<spack-view>/bin/python -c numpy\r\n```\r\nDoes not work.  Of course it doesn't work; because `$PYTHONPATH` is not set.  OTOH, loading an environment by loading 100 modules (`spack env loads -r`) does set `$PYTHONPATH` and DOES work.\r\n\r\nWhat is the recommended way to USE a Spack view, along with all the proper environment variables, once it is created?  Does Spack give any support / help on this front; e.g. by creating a module or to load to access the view?  Simply symlinking a bunch of files together is only half the job.\r\n",
