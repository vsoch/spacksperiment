Right now anybody bringing in any opengl dependency gets llvm forced on them.  I was surprised to see llvm building (and ultimately fail) for `py-matplotlib %gcc`.  The new package seems nice / it's cool to have different stuff in there, but this is a _huge_ dependency to bring in automatically for something like `mesa` in my opinion.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n    - Seems to be cause of https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/8074\r\n    - Introduced in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/10482\r\n        - CC: @chuckatkins (you know what's going on here best! :))\r\n- ~I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output~",
