That bug report includes the patch included here to allows a specific qtlocation 3rd party plugin (which is only used when `+opengl`) to compile with gcc-10.\r\n\r\nI tested that this patch applies cleanly against qt@5.12.7 through the most recent version, qt@5.14.2 at this time. The patch is set to apply for qt@5.12.7:5.15 since 5.16 has the fix upstream. Before qt@5.12.7 other patches fail to apply (`qt5-12-configure.patch` fails against qt@5.12.5), and spack never gets to trying to apply this new patch. mapbox-gl-native was added in qt@5.9, so before then the patch should not apply. The conflict excludes potentially problematic compiles instead of addressing the hypothetical of someone running gcc-10 but wanting a specific older version of qt.\r\n\r\nI tested that qt@5.12.7 and qt@5.14.2 both build fine with gcc@10.2.0 with this patch, but didn't explicitly build any versions in between (qt is a fairly big compile...).\r\n\r\nMaintainer tag: @sethrj ",
