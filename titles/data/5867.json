    "body": "This makes flake8 requirements stricter by:\r\n1. Disallowing the use of wildcard imports in the Spack core\r\n2. Restricting the use of wildcard imports to *only* `from spack import *` in packages.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't include `spack/__init__.py` yet, but the intent is to include it eventually.\r\nRationale: \r\n* not using wildcard imports allows us to detect undefined names and to find bugs, which we can't do if we use wildcards\r\n* It also makes dependencies between spack modules more obvious, and will help us refactor the Spack core for an eventual PyPI package\r\n\r\nSummary of this PR:\r\n- [x] Add a `--all` option to `spack flake8` so that we can check all Python files\r\n- [x] Separate the flake8 configuration between core and packages\r\n- [x] Remove all wildcards from core and all *but* `from spack import *` from packages.\r\n- [x] fix bugs discovered by the stricter flake8 settings.\r\n- [x] additional small flake8 and bug fixes\r\n\r\nI think this will make @jcftang happy.\r\n\r\n",
