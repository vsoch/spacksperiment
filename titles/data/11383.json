For example, on my installation of R, the path to the executable is correct, though the default libPath remains tied to the old location:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    root@gosset ~                                                                                          [11:30:56] \r\n> # which R                                                                                                      \r\n/opt/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-7.4.0/r-3.5.2-6sd4xtdyjin77zkwiasoa3iea4ukpttq/bin/R\r\n                                                                                                                  \r\nroot@gosset ~                                                                                          [11:30:58] \r\n> # R                                                                                                            \r\n\r\nR version 3.5.2 (2018-12-20) -- \"Eggshell Igloo\"\r\nCopyright (C) 2018 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing\r\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)\r\n\r\nR is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\r\nYou are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.\r\nType 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.\r\n\r\n  Natural language support but running in an English locale\r\n\r\nR is a collaborative project with many contributors.\r\nType 'contributors()' for more information and\r\n'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.\r\n\r\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or\r\n'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.\r\nType 'q()' to quit R.\r\n\r\n> .libPaths()\r\n[1] \"/mnt/beegfs/spackroot/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-7.4.0/r-3.5.2-6sd4xtdyjin77zkwiasoa3iea4ukpttq/rlib/R/library\"\r\n\r\n```\r\nIs there a way I can update the library paths within spack for interpreters like python, perl, and r, without having to recompile everything?\r\n\r\nM",
