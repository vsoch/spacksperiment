The 2018.10.12\r\nsnapshot number didn't fit well with spack's ordering (my bad), and\r\n1.4-rc1 is a near identical replacement.\r\n\r\nAdd a version for the 1.4-stable branch.\r\n\r\nAdd a variant for zlib compressed symbol tables (develop branch only).\r\n\r\nAdjust packages caliper and hpctoolkit to adapt to the changes.\r\n\r\nAdd myself as maintainer.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI grep'ed the package.py files and only caliper and hpctoolkit\r\nmentioned 2018.10.12, so no other package should be affected.\r\n\r\n@daboehme This is the (tiny) change to the caliper recipe that I told\r\nyou about last week.\r\n\r\nFor libunwind, 'stable' is at the low end of the spack ordering,\r\nalthough based on the git repo, it should go 1.4 < stable < develop.\r\n\r\nThis is mildly inconvenient in some places.  For example, in\r\nhpctoolkit, I have to say `depends_on('libunwind@1.4:,stable')`\r\ninstead of the more natural `depends_on('libunwind@1.4:')`.\r\n\r\nWould it make sense to add 'stable' as a special, high-order version\r\nname like develop and master?\r\n\r\nOr, could we add support for a per-package way of adjusting the\r\nordering?\r\n",
