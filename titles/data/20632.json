The only other package that even mentions\r\nlibunwind 1.4 or 1.5 is my package (hpctoolkit).  So, removing the\r\nrelease candidates should be safe.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, I plan to keep two moving branches: master and the most\r\nrecent stable branch, currently 1.5-stable, plus the point releases.",
