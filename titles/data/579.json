    "body": "This creates a cache directory for source archives under var/cache/ and avoids re-downloading source archives for package installs that use the same source (normally e.g. installing the same package with different build options would trigger a re-download). This is likely to primarily be useful to people testing several different build configurations of the same package.\n\nThis does not deal with caching for source control repositories (i.e. does not modify VCSFetchStrategy).\n\nEDIT (3/23): when this PR was started it did not handle caching VCSFetchingStrategy but has since been edited to support them.\n",
