To my chagrin, the developers borrow particular files out of other projects (which are available on github) at particular versions and treat them as projects that are independent of their parent.\r\n\r\nPart of me says that the correct way to handle this would be to ignore the copies out of other projects in conda, add the dependencies the files are copied from (at fixed versions), then have my target package (dxchange) provide the target package as well as the target package's dependencies by copying from the actual dependencies. Still, this feels really hacky to me and I'm open to suggestions on how it should be done.",
