    "body": "Python 3 metaclasses have a `__prepare__` method that lets us save the class's dictionary before it is constructed.  In Python 2 we had to walk up the stack using our `caller_locals()` method to get at this.  Using `__prepare__` is much faster as it doesn't require us to use `inspect`.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes multimethods use the faster `__prepare__` method in Python3, while still using `caller_locals()` in Python 2.  We try to reduce the use of caller locals using caching to speed up Python 2 a little bit.\r\n\r\nThis makes loading all packages in Python 3 ~25% faster for me (7.4 seconds vs. 10 seconds).",
