    "body": "This fixes a couple issues with the `-p,--prompt` option passed to `spack env activate`. \r\n\r\n* The escape sequences used to color+tag the Bash prompt with the name of the active Spack environment need to be enclosed in escaped square brackets. This is a special requirement when ANSI escape sequences are used to modify PS1, ensuring that the character count of the prompt  is accurate. \r\n\r\n* Invocation of `spack env activate -p <env>` when inside an already active Spack environment also activated with the `-p` switch led to problems like below:\r\n   - `$> spack env activate -p env1`\r\n   - `[env1] $> spack env activate -p env2`\r\n   - `[env2] [env1] $>`",
