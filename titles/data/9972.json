Also includes IOSS library and the aprepro library and application.   Documentation at http://gsjaardema.github.io/seacas/\r\n\r\nSeveral variants are available, but not all have yet been tested.  I have tested the default allpkgs build with and without mpi and that seems to be working correctly.\r\n\r\nBest current version of SEACAS source code is the `develop` branch on github.  I hope to have better versioning soon...",
