The old code relied on this and split the arrays by *not* quoting them.\r\n\r\nThis commit:\r\n- [x] Adds reads to convert flags to arrays.\r\n- [x] Makes the cc test check for improper space handling to prevent future regressions.\r\n- [x] Simplifies the cc tests further to avoid redundant code in the `check_` functions.\r\n\r\n@balay: please verify!\r\n@becker33: FYI",
