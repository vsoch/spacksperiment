Our `Repo` implementation can be simpler as a result.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- [x] consolidate all import logic into `spack.util.imp`, and make it use `importlib` if avialable.\r\n\r\n- [x] imp is the only way to do imports in 2.6, so we'll keep it around for\r\n  now and use it if importlib won't work.\r\n",
