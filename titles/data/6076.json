It doesn't fail to initialize anymore if the validated schema contains an array:  `TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str`.\r\n- Fixes for `schema/compilers.py`:\r\n  - it doesn't allow for almost an arbitrary set of properties anymore;\r\n  - property `modules` is not mandatory anymore and can be only an array;\r\n  - ~~property `target` becomes mandatory.~~\r\n  - property `target` gets default value `'any'`.\r\n- Tests to check that the fixes work.",
