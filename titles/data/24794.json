    "body": "This is WIP to fix #23891, which @adamjstewart reported.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that we hit the OS limits for filehandles when doing installs of large environments.  My hunch on this is because `installer.py` maintains read locks on everything it needs to install (so that we don't remove the dependencies of things we're installing), and we currently open a file every time we take a lock.  Really, Spack should be able to have a single open filehandle per lockfile, even if multiple byte ranges are held.\r\n\r\nThis isn't working but I figured I'd get a WIP PR in case anyone wants to look at it.",
