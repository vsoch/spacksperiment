    "body": "### Summary\r\nI am tempted to file this as a bug, but I suppose it is technically a feature request :)\r\n\r\n`cxxflags` and `cflags` as specified in `package.yaml` or even on the command line do not automatically get passed into CMake. (both ways just get into the `spec`.)\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nI currently have to explictly pass `cxxflags` and `cflags` into CMake in the QMCPACK Spack package:\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/blob/eb7c79720de66cc7b74ac0c6a1ce1d44ee670cd5/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/qmcpack/package.py#L183-L191\r\n\r\nIf you search through the contributed Spack packages that use CMake, it appears that many users are aware of this shortcoming and have implemented a similar solution. However, it would be much more preferable if this was not done on a per package basis but consistently in the Spack environment.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI think the best solution would be to have some code in the CMake base Python class to handle passing `cxxflags` and `cflags` into CMake automatically.\r\n\r\nBTW, `extra_rpath`, as specified in `packages.yaml`, is not passed into CMake either. I am not a CMake guru, but looked at this for a while and it was unclear how to properly pass an `rpath` to CMake.\r\n",
