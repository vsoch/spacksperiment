    "body": "When I tried installing `intel-parallel-studio@professional.2017.1 +all`, it crashed during `check_variants` and told me that I cannot use `+all` without specifying `+mpi`. There are two problems with that:\r\n\r\n1. The professional edition does not provide `+mpi`, so installing `+mpi` would be misleading\r\n2. What's the point of an `+all` variant that doesn't work unless you manually activate everything else by hand?\r\n\r\nThe main reason I use `+all` is because the default behavior is broken (see https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/2151#issue-185754092).\r\n\r\nHonestly, why don't we just remove all of the variants and always install everything? I can't think of a reason someone would want to install the parallel studio suite but not install mkl, for example. We could provide MPI when `@cluster`. It would also prevent bugs like installing `@cluster+all~mpi`, which technically doesn't provide MPI even though it gets installed.\r\n\r\n@lee218llnl ",
