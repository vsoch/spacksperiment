    "body": "fixes #20005 \r\n\r\nThe function we coded in Spack to load Python modules with arbitrary names from a file seem to have issues with local imports. For loading hooks though it is unnecessary to use such functions, since we don't care to bind a custom name to a module nor we have to load it from an unknown location.\r\n\r\nThis PR thus modifies `spack.hook` in the following ways:\r\n- [x] Use `__import__` instead of `spack.util.imp.load_source`\r\n- [x] Sync module docstring with all the hooks we have\r\n- [x] Avoid using memoization in a module function\r\n- [x] Marked with a leading underscore all the names that are supposed to stay local\r\n",
