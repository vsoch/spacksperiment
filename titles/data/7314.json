    "body": "( and dependendies and ids on macOS ). Added the routine to replace the original spack root directory with a placeholder string of the same length filled with @'s. After the placeholder or relative path replacement is done, the binary is checked for the spack root directory string. If it is, the buildcache creation process dies. A check is also made when the buildcache is installed. The install process dies if the old install root is found. More graceful exception handling has been added. Remove the option to create unsigned tarballs with -y. Use the -a option to create the tarballs anyway. This would allow one to relocate packages by taking the addition manual step of replacing strings in the binary( not recommended). Compiler can then be moved is additional compiler flags are used.\r\n\r\nMerges in \r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/pull/6740 Faster macOS relocation\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/pull/6546 Different install layout exception\r\n\r\nAddresses \r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues/7237 \r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues/6404\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues/6418\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues/6369\r\n",
