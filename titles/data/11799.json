Use cmake_args to set CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD as appropriate, plus use of FMT_USE_CPP11 option for C++98 builds. Use conflicts to disable use of certain standards in versions that don't support, or fail the build, with those standards. Use CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED to fail, at configure step only, use of compiler/cmake combination that do not support/know the requested standard.\r\n\r\nAdd patches to unify use of CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD in 3.0 versions, remove hard-coding of compiler flags in fmt-config.cmake, and prevent use of C++11 features in 4.1.0 when in supported C++98 mode.\r\n\r\nDefault to not building documents as no dependency on Doxygen is yet present, and they are not part of the \"all\" build.\r\n\r\nThe latest 5.3.0 version is added and checksummed.",
