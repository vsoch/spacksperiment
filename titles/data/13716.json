    "body": "While Spack's shell integration does work interactively in the shell, there are problems if it is used embedded into another script. The following shell script shows that modifications to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` will be overwritten by environment-modules:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=foobar\r\necho $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\n. ./share/spack/setup-env.sh\r\nspack load zlib target=x86_64\r\necho $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will print the following, that is, the initial value is lost:\r\n```\r\nfoobar\r\n[...]/opt/spack/linux-fedora31-x86_64/gcc-9.2.1/zlib-1.2.11-4zcnhczvb3xvv2vr5ezoh2un5equbddk/lib\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpack's shell integration still uses a module function copied from environment-modules@3, which exhibits this problem if used with environment-modules@4. Luckily, all versions ship appropriate init scripts that can be used instead.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the initial value will be preserved correctly:\r\n```\r\nfoobar\r\n[...]/opt/spack/linux-fedora31-x86_64/gcc-9.2.1/zlib-1.2.11-4zcnhczvb3xvv2vr5ezoh2un5equbddk/lib:foobar\r\n```",
