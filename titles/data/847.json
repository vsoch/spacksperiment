    "body": "##### Modifications :\n- [x] elapsed time has been added to each test case\n- [x] the xml file is pretty-printed\n- [x] `FetchError` exceptions are considered as errors in the tests\n- [x] `InstallError` exceptions are considered as failures in the tests\n- [x] fix unit tests failures due to refactoring  \n##### Notes\n\nThis is the modified version of `test-install` that we use internally at EPFL. I refactored the file quite a bit, but basically the added features / modified behaviors are the ones listed above.\n\nIf in the future we will start allowing for external dependencies, at least for a limited set of commands, then we may consider using [this](https://github.com/kyrus/python-junit-xml) (or similar things) to remove a hundred lines of code or so in `spack`.\n",
