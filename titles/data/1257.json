    "body": "I'm new to Spack, this is as much a question about how Spack thinks as it is a question about the lmod package....\n\nI'm working from a fairly minimal system image (Digital Ocean's CentOS 7 + the packages that LinuxBrew lists as prerequisites).\n\nI just used spack to install _lmod_.  Along the way I discovered that _lmod_ requires _tclsh_.  I used spack to install _tcl_.  The _tcl_ package has a tclsh8.6 in it's bin, but\n- w/out a module command there's no obvious way to get the _tcl_ package's `.../bin` on my path; and\n- the _tcl_ package doesn't link `tclsh8.6` to `tclsh`.\n\nI did both of these by hand so that I could make things work (I was working towards a working flake8 so that I could clean up my jdk PR), but clearly That's Not Right.  I'm trying to figure out what is the right way to handle this.\n\nPerhaps tcl is considered a Spack prerequisite?  Is there a list of prerequisites?\n\nOr would it be useful (is it possible?) for the lmod package to \"depend_on\" the tcl package if tclsh doesn't exist, and would satisfying that dependency (aka installing the _tcl_ package) set things up so that lmod's configure script would run successfully?\n",
