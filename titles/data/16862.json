But looks like Google guys didn't do that:\r\nhttps://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/5115\r\n\r\nSo, we attached a special patch for aarch64 with protobuf@2.5.0.\r\nAnd because protobuf changed it's package type, we enabled that package according to @alalazo 's suggestion (e.g. https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/15420)",
