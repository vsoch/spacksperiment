    "body": "The self-check code that was written to validate HDF5 post-installation didn't predict that the Spack versions might someday contain patches. Spack expects the HDF5 version to be reported as \"1.10.0-patch1\" but HDF5 reports its version as \"1.10.0\". This corrects that by only giving the first 3 digits.\n\nOf course, there are dozens of ways to strip \"-patch1\" from the end of the version number. If you think there's a safer/more future proof way of doing it, let me know.\n\n@eschnett: You wrote `check_install`. Does this change look good to you?\n",
