    "body": "On Big Sur, `gcc` can\u2019t detect the macOS version correctly. This causes a linker invocation with `gfortran` to try to link to `libgcc_s.10.4`, which isn\u2019t present on the system. This apparently only happens when `gfortran` is used to link a `.so` library, so it doesn\u2019t affect SciPy\u2019s dependencies: OpenBLAS uses `gfortran` to link, but is producing a `.dylib`; NumPy uses `clang` to link. It looks like the SciPy build system injects the `-mmacosx-version-min` flag (in `_build_utils/compiler_helper.py`) for the C++ compiler, but not for the Fortran compiler.\r\n\r\nThis PR gets around that by setting the `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to 10.15 (Catalina) when on Big Sur. This is incorrect, since it causes `gfortran` to identify the OS as Catalina, but at least it\u2019s close enough that it gets the linked library right. It looks like the `gfortran` behavior is updated for Big Sur in [this commit to the gcc codebase](https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=556ab5125912fa2233986eb19d6cd995cf7de1d2), but that\u2019s not available in a gcc release yet.",
