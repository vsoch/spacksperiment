Doing so would allow me to create a single set of configs that defines a complete spack environment, including where you can get the cached files associated with that environment\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nYou already support `spack env activate -d .; spack install` for installing an environment with multiple packages, but in order to create a build cache for that environment I need to parse my specs from `spack.yaml` manually using some script. This feels hacky and I'd like a single button to build and deploy my software. \"spack install\" seems like that button...\r\n",
