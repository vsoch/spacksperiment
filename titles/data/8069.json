The c++ stuff gets picked up or not [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/ed4321d1cb33199984118d801956822842771e7e/python/google/protobuf/internal/api_implementation.py#L40)\r\n\r\n~However, I can't figure out how to do that. I'm not seeing any way to set additional runtime environment variables in the docs (I might have missed them). Even if I found those, if I `spack activate py-protobuf` and then `module load python-[...]` but don't `module load py-protobuf-[...]`, that doesn't seem like it will pick up the flags?~",
