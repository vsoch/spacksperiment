    "body": "In my mind, the following distinction should be made:\n- `spack create`: create a new package\n- `spack edit`: edit an existing package\n\nHowever, `spack edit` is doing double duty, because if `spack create` fails or your software cannot be downloaded, then you need to run `spack edit -f` to create a new package. This is kind of confusing, but more importantly both `lib/spack/spack/cmd/create.py` and `lib/spack/spack/cmd/edit.py` have completely different default templates. The template in `edit.py` doesn't have license info, doesn't contain FIXME info, isn't PEP8 compliant, and assumes Autotools instead of saying Unknown build system.\n",
