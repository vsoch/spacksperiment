    "body": "Trying to make `spack -p` more useful for analyzing performance. I often want to try several sort orders, so this allows that without breaking different Python versions.\r\n\r\nInstead of supplying a default profile argument for `runctx`, which has not worked in the past because `runctx` takes different arguments across Python versions, use the `cProfile` and `pstats.Stats` API directly.  Allow the Spack user to specify what to sort by, since the *fields* you can sort by differ across Python versions, too.  By default, sort by `time`, which is available across versions and is more sensible than the default sort order.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add -P <STAT> argument so that caller can specify a sort column for cProfile. Can specify multiple columns with commas. e.g.:\r\n    ```\r\n    spack -P cumtime,module\r\n    ```\r\n- [x] Sort by time by default (because it works in all Python versions)\r\n- [x] Show sort column options in command help.  Looks like:\r\n    ```\r\n     -P STAT, --sorted-profile STAT\r\n                            profile and sort by one or more of:\r\n                            [cumulative, module, ncalls, pcalls, file, line, name,\r\n                             calls, stdname, nfl, filename, cumtime, time, tottime]\r\n    ```\r\n- [x] Do a short profile run in the unit tests.",
