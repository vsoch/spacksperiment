This generally is a good idea, so that the server gets started during boot. This means, that the socket is in the system's `/var`.\r\n\r\nIf one now wants to use the client part (library!) via spack, one has a problem: spack's munge looks in SPACK-PACKAGE-PREFIX/var for the socket.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a way to let the spack installed package use the system's socket.\r\n\r\nSo add a variant to override the path during build: `localstatedir=/var`.",
