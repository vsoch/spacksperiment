This adds a flag in the database (not in the spec) to tell you which packages were explicitly requested by a user (True) and which were brought in as dependencies (False).\n\nSpack find has flags to list only explicit packages.\n\nLooking at this, the default should probably be True, as most callers external to Package are usually requesting something they really want. The recursive install calls should worry about setting it to False, not the user.\n",
