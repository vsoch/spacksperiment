    "body": "Tix appears to be old, but a user at LLNL has requested it be supported in Python. It looks like Tix uses structures in tcl that were removed from tcl 8.6, hence the dependence on older versions. Because of this, I thought it would be best to make tix a variant in python that is not enabled by default, rather than forcing all python builds to use the older tcl/tk versions.",
