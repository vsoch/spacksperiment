    "body": "The git Makefile comes with two targets, `check` and `test`. However, these targets are completely different. `make test` runs the unit tests, while `make check` runs a static analysis tool called `sparse`. Instead of adding a new dependency to `git`, I decided to override the default `check` phase and only run `make test`. I have a feeling `make check` is intended for developers only.",
