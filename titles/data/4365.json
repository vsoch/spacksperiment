[Here is the release page](https://github.com/lh3/bwa/releases).\r\n\r\nYesterday I added info for `@0.7.12` and last night `@0.7.15` failed to fetch because it tried to use a pattern based on the `0.7.12` URL.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n   url      = \"https://github.com/lh3/bwa/releases/download/v0.7.15/bwa-0.7.15.tar.bz2\"\r\n\r\n   version('0.7.15', 'fcf470a46a1dbe2f96a1c5b87c530554')\r\n   version('0.7.12', 'e24a587baaad411d5da89516ad7a261a',\r\n           url='https://github.com/lh3/bwa/archive/0.7.12.tar.gz')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a feeling this is not a new situation.  Is there a standard approach?\r\n\r\n",
