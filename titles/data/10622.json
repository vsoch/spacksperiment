It universally adds `lib`/`lib64` directories as link/rpath directories. It also filters system paths from link/rpaths/includes.\r\n\r\n* remove system paths from link/rpath/include dirs\r\n* remove duplicate paths from collected link/rpath/include dirs\r\n* always add lib and lib64 directories since default .libs only reports libs with a name matching the package name",
