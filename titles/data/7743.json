    "body": "fixes #659\r\n\r\nCurrently the `spack env` command fails if more than one token is given for the spec, like:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack env zlib %gcc\r\n```\r\nThis is because the tokens after the first one are interpreted as a command to be executed in the environment.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior described above to make it more consistent with that of other commands. Now all of the tokens are interpreted as being part of the spec, and if we want to execute a command in the environment we need to separate it from the spec with '--'.",
