However this only collects patches that are associated with the `Package` object and does not include `Spec`-related patches (which are applied by dependents, added in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/5476). ~This updates the `Package.patches_to_apply` function to add `Spec` patches.~\r\n\r\nEDIT: turns out `Spec.patches` already collects patches from the package so the `Package.patches_to_apply` function isn't necessary. All uses of `Package.patches_to_apply` are replaced with `Package.spec.patches`.",
