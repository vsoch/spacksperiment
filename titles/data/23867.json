Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install intel-oneapi-mpi\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n```console\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2778-b27ccd5\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-broadwell\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\nUse external package to override libfabric to use OS supplied version.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n\r\nHave proposed changes at ARCCA@8f20f9acd705dd3919bfc7e66a1e7c6593669753\r\n\r\nPackage didnt fail, it was more at runtime it picked up Intel internal libfabric which was incompatible with system I was using.  Intel provide an option to `setenv.sh` with:\r\n```console\r\n-i_mpi_ofi_internal specifies whether to use libfabric from the Intel(R) MPI Library.\r\n```\r\n \r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n@DanVev   @rscohn2 \r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [ x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [ x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [ x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
