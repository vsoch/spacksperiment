Without this PR, the package will most likely fail with something like this:\r\n```\r\nconfigure: error: C compiler cannot create executables\r\n```\r\nWith this PR, Spack will check beforehand:\r\n```\r\n==> Error: '/usr/bin/gcc123' is not a valid path for compiler 'gcc@9.2.1'on operating system 'fedora31'.\r\nPlease use 'spack compiler' to diagnose and fix the problem.\r\n```",
