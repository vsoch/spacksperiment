This is to avoid \"installing\" secret tokens, passwords and keys often set in CI.\r\n\r\nHalfway this PR the original behavior of installing all variables was still available through `spack install --env-variables`, but that flag is now dropped (67e2bea01dd04c07161c53f587440071fd2c6f38).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n <summary>Original description:</summary>\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't persist environment variables to disk by default, and we should definitely not install them on shared instances and pipelines.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that we do not have a `<install prefix>/.spack/spack-build-env.txt` file and that the `<stage dir>/spack-build-env.txt` file has 600 permissions (that is read-write for the user only: `-rw-------`)\r\n\r\nThe only potentially safe thing to do is to store the environment *modifications* of spack's build environment, but until that is figured out, it's better to drop this entirely.\r\n</details>",
