This also means that certain issues like trailing whitespace on long lines, that were previously masked by appending of things like `# noqa: E501`, now show up.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that all packages pass the style check so people don't run into foreign errors in their PRs.\r\n\r\n- [x] fix trailing whitespace and other issues uncovered by better `flake8` checking in \r\n- [x] fix superfluous whitespace printed by `spack style` command",
