    "body": "Starting with `intel-parallel-studio` 2020 the `+vtune` variant gets ignored, meaning that after the installation the `vtune` executable can not be found.\r\nThe reason for this is that the package folder got renamed (again), from `vtune_amplifer` to `vtune_profiler`.\r\nThis PR does what has been done before: renaming the default package name for the `vtune` variant to `vtune_profiler` and patching the `normalize_path` function to transparently use `vtune_amplifier_xe` for `:2017` and `vtune_amplifier` for `:2019`.\r\nHence fixing the missing `vtune` package for `intel-parallel-studio@cluster.2020 +vtune`.",
