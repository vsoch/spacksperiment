    "body": "<!-- Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\nExample: \"I ran `spack find` to list all the installed packages and ...\" -->\r\n\r\nSpack fails to properly parse a spec.yaml passed on the command line if the path to that file includes certain characters.  I suspect that these problematic characters may include `+` and/or `-`, though there may be others.  In my case, I ran into this problem as part of a spack ci process that was partially customized.  Among these customizations included a process whereby a job's build directory included a component that is made up of a base64-encoded hash.  This wouldn't be as much of an issue for me if not for the fact that `spack ci` runs a `spack install` command internally, and it is this internal invocation that is failing (presumably, because it does not explicitly pass `-f` to disambiguate).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ docker run --rm -it spack/centos7\r\n\r\n# from within the container:\r\n$ spack spec --yaml zlib > zlib.yaml\r\n$ mkdir EW3t+qT-TTxd1B5CjT+8J0GT8sI  # example path component\r\n$ ln -s ../zlib.yaml EW3t+qT-TTxd1B5CjT+8J0GT8sI/zlib.yaml\r\n\r\n# OK\r\n$ spack spec ./zlib.yaml\r\n$ spack spec /root/zlib.yaml\r\n$ spack install ./zlib.yaml\r\n$ spack install /root/zlib.yaml\r\n\r\n# FAIL - Same exact file, different path\r\n$ spack spec /root/EW3t+qT-TTxd1B5CjT+8J0GT8sI/zlib.yaml\r\n$ spack spec ./EW3t+qT-TTxd1B5CjT+8J0GT8sI/zlib.yaml\r\n$ spack install /root/EW3t+qT-TTxd1B5CjT+8J0GT8sI/zlib.yaml\r\n$ spack install ./EW3t+qT-TTxd1B5CjT+8J0GT8sI/zlib.yaml\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message.
