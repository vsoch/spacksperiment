    "body": "At times when I hit spack bugs, I will remove the .spack-env/view directory as that seems to solve some issues and get back to a clean state (I know, need to file a bug for that too). Recently I added an npm dependency to my package, and found that when the .spack-env/view directory didn't exist, spack reindex would fail because .spack-env/view/npm-cache didn't exist. The npm package contains logic to create this directory if it doesn't exist, but doesn't handle the case where the view directory itself doesn't exist, as it's using mkdir() and not mkdirp().\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n- Add a package to your environment that has a dependency on npm.\r\n- spack install\r\n- remove .spack-env/view directory\r\n- spack reindex\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack reindex\r\n==> No such file or directory .spack-env/view/npm-cache\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\nspack debug report\r\nusage: spack debug [-h] SUBCOMMAND ...\r\nspack debug: error: argument SUBCOMMAND: invalid choice: 'report' choose from:\r\n    create-db-tarball\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\nspack --version\r\n0.14.2-2-57a1c091f\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
