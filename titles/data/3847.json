Note that:\r\nhttps://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CACertificates#Mac_OS_X_10.6_and_higher\r\nhas several suggestions for how to solve this problem, but none of them seem to work. They claim that:\r\n\r\n> Mercurial 3.2 or later enables the dummy certificate trick by default.\r\n\r\nbut it doesn't seem to work for our Spack build. When I build mercurial outside of Spack with ananconda python, it works. But when I link to Spack's Python build, it no longer works. Maybe Python isn't built properly either?",
