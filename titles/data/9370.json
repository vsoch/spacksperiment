    "body": "The rdma-core code base will use the build path to construct string constants at cmake time (see https://github.com/linux-rdma/rdma-core/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L102), which can then trigger the failure of compile time string length safety checks in the code base (see https://github.com/linux-rdma/rdma-core/blob/master/librdmacm/acm.c#L170) if the path is too deep.\r\n\r\nThis problem is relatively easy to trigger in spack if your staging path is something like \"/gpfs/mira-home/carns/working/src/spack/opt/spack/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/rdma-core-20-jseuuuvggown67ufiu74quv64aopa2xp/\"\r\n\r\nThis PR explicitly sets a cmake option to override the rundir and set it to a fixed absolute path (/var/run) so that the rdma-core spack package will build reliably regardless of spack staging path.",
