    "body": "This is a quick and dirty way to add support for global debug flags, currently via environment variables that then are seen by the compiler wrapper and added. It will hopefully be much more useful than #23231. We probably eventually want to make it possible to derive these envars starting from the command line, but talking with @trws it sounds like the traditional flag system / build environment variables that are set has a hook that runs after where a package can muck with the flags, meaning a user might request something and it never gets there. So we would need a different strategy.\r\n\r\n## Questions to discuss\r\n\r\n - Did I add the flags in the right place (at the beginning, only because I've seen them there)?\r\n - How can we test this? I can test locally manually and confirm that debug symbols show up, but I'm not sure how that fits into the spack testing system\r\n\r\nping @trws  ! This was so much easier than the other way!\r\n\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
