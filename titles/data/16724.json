    "body": "(UPDATE: Was #16654 but renamed to fix typo in the branch name.)\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an issue raised in `slack` where a package that is already installed but has uninstalled dependencies was having its dependencies re-installed even when those dependencies were not needed to use the package.\r\n\r\nTodd recommended using pre- (versus post-) order traversals to prune installed dependencies when initializing the build queue so that has been included.\r\n\r\nThere is a third commit to replace `try-finally` blocks with attribute assignments that attempt to do the equivalent of `monkeypatch` but does not always work as expected.  For example, at one point tests using `canfail` with initial installs with `succeed` set to `False` then run after setting `succeed` to `True` would fail with complaints that `succeed` was [still] `False`.  Using the testing framework's `monkeypatch` seemed to solve this problem.",
