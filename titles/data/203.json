    "body": "The gcc package currently depends on the system libstdc++ to bootstrap rather than building its own.  Certain systems with incredibly ancient versions of libstdc++, which will remain nameless to protect the guilty, can't build the gcc 5.2 version because of this behavior.  Probably the best way to fix this is to rework the process to bootstrap gcc completely from scratch, but I'm not sure whether this is best done as a rework of the gcc package itself, or a split into a libc, libstdc++ and gcc packages.  The latter seems to make more sense on the surface, but because of the cycle of rebuilds required the former might be the only way to do it without leaving partial bootstrap versions around.\n",
