    "body": "This commit provides a basic MOAB installation.  MOAB has many optional features that I did not setup or test.  I will leave the addition of those variants to someone who is actually using them.\n\nInformation on MOAB: https://bitbucket.org/fathomteam/moab\n\nMOAB is a component for representing and evaluating mesh data. MOAB can store structured and unstructured mesh, consisting of elements in the finite element 'zoo.' The functional interface to MOAB is simple yet powerful, allowing the representation of many types of metadata commonly found on the mesh. MOAB is optimized for efficiency in space and time, based on access to mesh in chunks rather than through individual entities, while also versatile enough to support individual entity access\n",
