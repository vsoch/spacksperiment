Closes #4161. \r\n\r\n@davydden The reason that the compiler wrappers weren't working for `suite-sparse` was because we weren't using the compiler wrappers! `self.compiler.cc` isn't the compiler wrapper, it's the path to the actual compiler. We already set `CC` and friends elsewhere in Spack, so removing them solves the problem.\r\n\r\n@svenevs Can you confirm that this solves the problem you were seeing? I just built `suite-sparse+tbb` locally.",
