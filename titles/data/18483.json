    "body": "Fixes #18463.\r\n\r\nAMD's fork of clang is used by some packages either indirectly through `hipcc` (rocfft, roclbas, etc) or directly (rocm-device-libs). This bypasses Spack's compiler wrappers, which causes issues with linking, rpaths and it skips microarch optimization flags. In particular, `hipcc` 3.7.0 always adds an `-lnuma` flag, but numactl might currently not end up in the rpaths.\r\n\r\nThis patch is an ugly hack to fix this. It replaces the `clang` and `clang++` symlinks with Spack's compiler wrapper. As it turns out, even though `clang++` itself is merely a symlink, it has to be called `clang++` for it to realize it is a c++ compiler/linker, so we cannot simply rename `clang++` to `amd-clang++` or so. Instead, this patch creates a `bin/orig/clang` and `bin/orig/clang++`  symlinks pointing to `bin/clang-11`, and makes the compiler wrapper in `bin/clang` and `bin/clang++` call `bin/origin/clang` and `bin/orig/clang++`.",
