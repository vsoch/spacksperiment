So, I thought: \"Let spack manage gcc!\" After running `spack spec -I gcc` and seeing it wanted to install `perl` and the like, I decided to read the docs and learned about `spack external find`. Nice. But running it led to an error. \r\n\r\nJust to be doubly sure it wasn't my fault, I nuked my old `.spack` directory (since I didn't know about `spack external find` my spack knowledge is out of dat) as well as re-cloned the spack repo from scratch. Same issue.
