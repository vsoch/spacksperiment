I haven't identified the source of the error, but decided it should reported sooner rather than later.  Can anyone else confirm this behavior after updating with the feature/sbang update?\n\nBTW - after the above error, if you blindly rerun `spack install qt` (`libxcb` isn't actually installed, but spack thinks it is), the same error message shows up in qt before compiling starts.\n",
