    "body": "I develop some packages at SNL that have per-variant submodules and there isn't currently a way to update them, without doing things like monkey-patching `Package._make_stage` to intercept and override calls to the fetch strategy's `fetch` method.  This PR implements a method of defining a package version's submodules as a string, list, or callable, in addition to the currently supported bool.  The callable method allows calling back with the package's `spec` and defining modules on a per-variant basis.\r\n\r\nThere is probably a cleaner way of getting the `spec` object back to the submodule callable method, this is just a proof of concept.\r\n\r\nNOTE: so far as a I can tell, having a `version`'s submodules argument take a callable is the only way to enable per-variant submodule updates.  This is very important for a few packages we develop that have massive submodules (tens of gigabytes) that we don't want to update, unless their variants are explicitly requested.",
