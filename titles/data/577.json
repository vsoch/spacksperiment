    "body": "Currently the following undesired behaviour may appear.\n`petsc` has `depends_on('boost', when='+boost')`. However, if the user has `boost +mpi` installed, `petsc` would still try to install yet another boost, supposedly because `boost != boost +mpi` somewhere in the core.\n\nWhen a decision is made to install or not another variant, IMHO the comparator should behave like\n`boost && boost +mpi => true (do not install)`\nwhereas\n`boost && boost -filesystem => false`.\nThat is, anything that extends the default variant should be as good as default. Whereas if some features are disabled, then one might need to reinstall it.\n",
