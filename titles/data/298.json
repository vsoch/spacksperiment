    "body": "Modifications :\n- [x] added a class decorator to easily create composite over an interface or a series of methods\n- [x] `spack/package.py` : moved complexity from `do_stage` and `do_fetch` to `stage` and `fetch` property\n- [x] simplified logic in `mirror.py` (stage and fetcher creation is left to pkg)\n- [x] fix the two unit tests that are failing due to the changes in `stage.py` and `fetch_strategy.py`\n- [x] unit tests for composite class decorator\n- [x] the `resource` directive can now use all available fetchers\n- [x] `llvm` can now build the latest `trunk` (`llvm@develop`) as an example of the capability above\n\nAny comment on the code is more than welcome!\n\n@tgamblin : the API of `Stage` and `FetchStrategy` needs to be modified further to avoid exposing the items in the composite after its construction (for instance I would like to avoid the `for` loop in `mirror.py` and the conditional used to construct `name` and `archive_path`). I start a PR early to receive comments on this and see if the changes here fit with what you have in mind for this part of the code. \n",
