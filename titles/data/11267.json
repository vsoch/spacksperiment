    "body": "Two versions of `leveldb` are available: 1.18 and 1.20 . There is no `develop` version available in spack.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nSome packages (e.g FAODEL #11268 ) search for `leveldb` using `CMake` function `find_package()` which expects to find a file called `leveldb-config.cmake`. However, this file is not available for the versions of this package available in `spack` but it is available in its `master` branch.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe solution is a add a `develop` version of `leveldb` that points to its GitHub `master` branch.",
