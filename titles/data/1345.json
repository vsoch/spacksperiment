The system perl is not always sufficient to install git (e.g. a CentOS7 system with the development tools group installed has perl but not the ExtUtils::MakeMaker package that git needs) and one can't always update the system's perl.\n\nThis PR depends_on PR #1339, which adds a perl package to spack.\n",
