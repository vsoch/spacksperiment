    "body": "Previously, I was able to build *trilinos* against a specific version of *superlu-dist* like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack install trilinos+superlu-dist ^superlu-dist@4.3 ^netlib-lapack\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, with the current _develop_ branch, I get this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Error: trilinos does not depend on superlu-dist\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `spack info` and reviewing `trilinos/package.py` it is clear that the `+superlu-dist` variant should be available.  I'm wondering if this is broken due to the hyphen in the name.  (I should note that `spack install trilinos+boost ^boost@1.63.0` seems to work.)\r\n\r\nAny ideas on why this doesn't work any longer?",
