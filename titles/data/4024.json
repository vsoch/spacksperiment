Are there any features that you may find helpful?\r\n\r\nFeatures I have in mind:\r\n1. maintainers communicate approvals of PRs and, when certain conditions have been met, the bot automatically performs a merge\r\n1. the bot could ensure that contributors have signed a license agreement or have signed-off on their commits\r\n1. the bot could collect information from people who create issues or PRs and update the labels to match some predefined states\r\n\r\nAre there other tasks that could be helped by a bot?",
