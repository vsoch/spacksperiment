    "body": "Fixes #1521: slow CLI with many installations.\n\nThis reduces an 40-second `spack find` invocation to 1 second on my machine, and it should scale much better to large numbers of specs than the previous implementation.  I believe the bottleneck is reading the YAML file now (which should remain pretty fast), not processing the specs.\n\nSteps taken:\n- Implemented more aggressive hash caching so that we don't re-hash specs repeatedly when we look things up in the database.\n- Implemented better load logic in the database:\n  - database is now a proper Merkle DAG -- fewer redundant specs.\n  - construction algorithm is much faster and makes three passes instead of redundant descent into dependencies.\n\n@adamjstewart @sknigh @davydden @alalazo @citibeth care to try this out?\n",
