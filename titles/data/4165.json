These macros are also added to the language specific variables like CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and FCFLAGS. \r\n- [x] Changed `spec.satisfies('foo')` with `'foo' in spec` in `intel-mkl`, see #4135. \r\n- [x] Added a basic build interface to `intel-mpi`.\r\n- [x] Don't re-raise from `__exit__` as it doesn't respect the context manager protocol.",
