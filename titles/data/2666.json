    "body": "@tgamblin In #2664, we seem to have discovered that many strange bugs happen when you concretize a spec more than once in a run of Spack.  We're solving the immediate problem by removing unnecessary (and VERY inefficient) multiple concretizations.  But I think this also points to a possible problem somewhere deep in the concretization / memoization logic; a bug that could bite us again elsewhere.\r\n\r\n",
