    "body": "Defaults back to `shared=True`.  The \"fix\" for macOS was only needed for Python 2.7, which is now EOL.  And the fix itself caused problems for certain things that depend on Python.  Once I discovered this, I had to rebuild Python itself and then most of my software stack.\r\n\r\nIf there were a way to default to `shared=False` for macOS but ONLY for `python@2.7`, that would be best.  Otherwise, I think that removing the \"fix\" (but leaving explanatory comments) is best.",
