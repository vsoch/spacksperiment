Without the -v option to install this fails confusingly opaquely as reported in #4887\r\n\r\nThis should be handled by the petsc package.py to fail with a helpful message rather than result in opaque build failure.\r\n\r\nHappy to make the PR but would like to request input on what approach to take:\r\n\r\n1. If ~double specified without ~hypre\\~superlu-dist then give an error and quit\r\n\r\n1. If ~double specified then force ~hypre\\~superlu-dist\r\n\r\nComments?",
