    "body": "Fixes the logic Spack uses when getting keys from a mirror, which was broken after merging #15002 and #15361.\r\n\r\n- ~Update `spack.util.web.list_url()` to iterate recursively over all files~\r\n   - ~Changed to be more consistent across `s3://` and `file://` URLs.~\r\n\r\n - ~Changed `bindist.get_keys()` so that it no longer depends on an index.~\r\n   - ~Instead, it will find *all* files under the prefix URL that end\r\n     with .key or .pub~\r\n\r\n - Simplified `bindist.get_keys()` so that it uses the web/url abstraction\r\n   instead of separate code paths for `s3://` and `file://` resources.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix tests\r\n- [x] Confirm getting keys from mirror is working\r\n- [x] Add new tests covering changes\r\n\r\nEDIT: Crossed out parts of this PR that has since changed.  See discussion for details.",
