Or does it get installed whereever the `spack` git package is located?\r\n* Does it share dependencies like `pacman` does so it doesn't take extra space?\r\n* Am I able to specify the flags (like with Gentoo's portage package manager) so I can get higher optimisations?\r\n* How many packages are available in the repo? Is it less than the official Arch Linux repository?\r\n* Is it in beta or stable?",
