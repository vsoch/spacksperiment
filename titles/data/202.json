    "body": "WIP for using nose to generate XML output for Spack unit tests \n\nThis includes:\n- Updating lib/spack/spack/test/**init**.py to make use of nose\n- Updating logic which depends on stdout having a file descriptor (as nose can assign stdout to a StringIO which doesn't have one)\n- Using a nose plugin to keep track of the number of failures/successes/errors (nose.run does not provide an object which accounts for this)\n- nose looks for unit tests by checking for methods which have the prefix \"test\" (in particular it can include functions defined outside of a unittest.TestCase implementation) so I had to rename a helper method (in unit_install.py)\n\nIncluding the nose files in external made it difficult to navigate the comparison so I thought I'd start here and add them in when things look nearly complete.\n",
