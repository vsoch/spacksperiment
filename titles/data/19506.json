This package does not appear to have the same requirements so it looked like it could be separated out.\r\n\r\nAt least one concern brought up by @rscohn2 was that both this and and Spack's `intel` package provide `icc` executables, so it may be confusing for users who want to install `icc`. I think this could be resolved by adding an `icc` virtual (provided by `intel` and `intel-oneapi`).\r\n\r\n@rscohn I had a couple questions:\r\n\r\n* Is `icc` distinct from `icx` (i.e. do they produce different compiled executables)?\r\n* If the answer to the first question is \"no\", will `icx` be completely replacing `icc` at some point in the future?\r\n\r\nTODOs\r\n\r\n- [ ] I may need to tweak this to support bootstrapping of compiler installs (so that `spack install foo%intel-oneapi` will automatically install `intel-oneapi`\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/19330 (which adds the compiler definition)",
