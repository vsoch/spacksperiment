    "body": "from @tgamblin \r\n\r\n> We may want to have spack packages standardize on either lib or lib64. Each package builds for one architecture so there isn't really a reason to have both. Also, with views people symlink packages into a common prefix. I'd like to make views more common/automatic but it's awkward to load views into the environment if different packages in the same view have different lib directories. I'm trying to think of a reason we wouldn't want to force one or the other of lib/lib64.\r\n\r\nThis would be good to have, but it may be difficult to implement as one needs a specific OS to encounter such behaviour (i.e. `netcdf-cxx` installs to `lib` on `ubuntu 16.04`, but uses `lib64` on `opensuse tumbleweed`). Also some packages may not have an option to control libs location, then one would need to move libs post-install and if there are more than one, do extra patching.\r\n\r\nTaking the above into account, I think it may be easier to address such problems with https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/1875 where each package would know things about itself.\r\n ",
