    "body": "This PR updates the version of R to 3.3.0. It also runs it and the existing R extensions through autopep8. This PR also adds curl and pcre dependencies. In the case of pcre, this PR adds a 'utf' variant to the pcre package, set to True by default.\n\nThe BiocGenerics package was updated. This is a BioConductor package and the issue is that the bioconductor repositories only maintain the latest versions. I am not sure what the best way is to handle that in spack. There could potentially be plenty of bioconductor packages so it may be best to treat them in a different way from other R packages. There is a bioconductor installer that will manage the packages but it does not really fit the \"spack way\".\n",
