    "body": " install libpython.py when installing python\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nInstalling this gdb extension would dramatically improve the debugging experience  with python with C extensions.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nlibpython.py is a gdb extension written by the python core developers which provides several helper functions for debugging python c extensions using gdb such as `py-bt` which translates the full C backtrace in to a python readable back trace.  Right now we don't install it. According to the documentation, it is generated when the python library is built.\r\n\r\nhttps://devguide.python.org/gdb/\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThere are a few other packages which provide gdb extensions such as gcc's libstdc++, so an appealing way to solve this would be to make gdb extendable and have python extend gdb to provide this file, however, this would create a circular dependency between gdb and python since gdb depends on python to provide the embedded interpreter within gdb and this file is meaningless without the gdb and the gdb module.  I'm not sure how to resolve this.\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart ping'ing you as requested.  I'm not in a hurry to fix this before the new year.\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n\r\n0.16.0-220-cf37e9276\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n",
