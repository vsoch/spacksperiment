    "body": " this is a first try on the elk code package, written from scratch. Please, review. I don't expect it to be merged, but I ask for a code review.\r\n\r\nI didn't use official spack blas/lapack virtual packages, because elk doesn't appear to like linking against 'generic' blas/lapack and wants to tune its own code somewhat for linking with supported openblas, mkl and blis.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there might be some dirty secrets in mkl/blis integration AND mkl can be also used to provide fft. Since I only really wanted openblas+fftw3, I didn't bother with mkl/blis\r\n\r\nwannier90 and MPI variants are provided and appear to work\r\n\r\nIt appears that Elk is meant to compile with openMP no mater what, so didn't do openMP variant. \r\n\r\nI tested if it builds with gradually turned on variants. Didn't test how the resulting elk works yet, but I tested earlier dynamically linked elk built without spack and it worked fine, so I think this one should work well too.\r\n",
