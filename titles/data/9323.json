    "body": "Spack should work on Windows.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nRight now, I am able to use Spack on Linux and Mac and HPC, but some of our users/customers use Windows, and so we can't use Spack for that. If Spack is to become *the* package manager, it has to support Windows, as it is a very important platform.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt should support MSVC as one of the compilers and in general compile packages natively on Windows using any compilers that the user selects (MSVC, mingw, ...).",
