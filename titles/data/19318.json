    "body": "Hi,\r\nWe are attempting to use [Score-P](https://www.vi-hps.org/projects/score-p/) to analyze applications.\r\nTo do this the command \"scorep\" must be appended to all compile and link commands\r\n`\r\nscorep  mpif90 app1.f90 app2.f90 -o app\r\n`\r\nMy question is, what is the Spack Way to get this done?\r\nI have successfully done this by editing the package.py and either adding patching the makefile, and/or using the filter_file function to replace \"mpif90\" with  \"scorep mpif90\". While this works, it can be a bit tedious and leave room for error.\r\nAny other ways i am not thinking of? Could a custom compiler be defined that adds this automatically?\r\n\r\nThanks,",
