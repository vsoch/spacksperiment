However there is also a bug in compiler-rt upstream in LLVM that doesn't honor this variable either which just delays this problem to later on in the build process.\r\n\r\nThe following *mostly* fixes this if compiling LLVM against python3, but we also need to check what verison of python spack is building against and possibly set `Python2_EXECUTABLE` instead.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncmake_args.append(\"-DPython3_EXECUTABLE:PATH={0}\".format(spec[\"python\"].command.path),)\r\n```\r\n\r\n@naromero77  @trws\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n[spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5539978/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n[spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5539979/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n[spack-configure-args.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5539980/spack-configure-args.txt)\r\n\r\n",
