    "body": "\r\nThis is a small thing.  I'm not blocked on it or anything.  But it\r\nmakes sense and does have its use case.\r\n\r\nRight now, there is `url_for_version()` for constructing a complicated\r\nURL from its version.  A quick grep through the packages directory\r\nshows about 140 packages that use this.\r\n\r\nCould we add `url_for_resource()` for packages that use resources with a\r\ncomplicated URL that varies by version?\r\n\r\nNote: a package has only one URL per version, but it may have many\r\nresources (see llvm).  So, I guess you'd want the signature to look\r\nsomething like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef url_for_resource(self, version, name):\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `name` is a string.  `version` is actually a class, but I'm\r\nguessing `name` is probably just a string.\r\n\r\nI would use this for hpcviewer.  Grepping the packages directory, I\r\ncount 77 unique packages that use at least one resource.  I don't\r\nspeak for llvm, but the llvm package has long tables of URLs and\r\nchecksums, they might use it.\r\n\r\nI could try copying the code for `url_for_version()` into the Resource\r\nclass, but I'm not that confident that I'd hook it up correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
