    "body": "Utility functions that enhance the 'parallel' package and support the\r\nbuilt-in parallel backends of the 'future' package. For example,\r\navailableCores() gives the number of CPU cores available to your R\r\nprocess as given by the operating system, 'cgroups' and Linux\r\ncontainers, R options, and environment variables, including those set by\r\njob schedulers on high-performance compute clusters. If none is set, it\r\nwill fall back to parallel::detectCores(). Another example is\r\nmakeClusterPSOCK(), which is backward compatible with\r\nparallel::makePSOCKcluster() while doing a better job in setting up\r\nremote cluster workers without the need for configuring the firewall to\r\ndo port-forwarding to your local computer.",
