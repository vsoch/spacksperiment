The std cmake args include `-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON`, which causes bits of the cmake verbose output to be embedded in the configure script.  This, in turn, wreaks havoc.\r\n\r\nSee  https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/15274 and https://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto/issues/253 for additional details.\r\n\r\nCloses #15274 ",
