    "body": "I think the only controversial change here is a change in how our configuration scopes are presented. Previously, we listed the custom scope added via `--config-scope` as \"command line\" scope. However, there is actually a higher precedence scope of build settings listed on the command line. I separated \"command line\" into \"custom\" and \"command line\" to distinguish this. Let me know how people feel about this change before I make the same change to the Configuration Tutorial.",
