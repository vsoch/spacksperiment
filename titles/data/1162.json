    "body": "I used to install `tmux` via Spack, and then run it via its path, e.g. as `/work/00507/eschnett/src/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos6-x86_64/gcc-6.1.0-spack/tmux-2.2-7mbznhvouy5l5gbqy7djtlczsz5ip3hg/bin/tmux`. Since recently this does not work any more; I then receive the error message\n\n```\nopen terminal failed: can't find terminfo database\n```\n\nSince there was no recent change to the `tmux` package, I wonder whether Spack's handling of environment variables changed, and could be causing this problem?\n",
