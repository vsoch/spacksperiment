    "body": "I know this doesn't come up on supercomputers because the architecture of all of the nodes is identical. However I ran into an odd problem building gcc on a build server and using it on another machine. The relocated compiler worked as long as I disabled the binutils and gold options. That was a few merges from develop ago. Now when I try to compile with the relocated compiler I get error messages about illegal instructions. As near as I can tell from googling the error message, the compiler or its dependent packages have been optimized to use instructions only found on the build server AMD processor. I thought I should point this out in case you are installing the compiler to an nfs mount and the compiler might be run on machines with different architectures.",
