Since we don't set RPATH or RUNPATH, and rely on the internal rpath's in the binaries to help us not manage RPATH/RUNPATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH, the failover isn't going to work.  Other than our explicitly going through the packages and updating the rpath, is there any way to tell spack to just use the original cwd\r\nas opposed to replacing the symbolic links with the actual hard paths?\r\n\r\n",
