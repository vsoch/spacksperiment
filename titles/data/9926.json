That seems to have stalled, with a lot of complexity. This PR is simpler, and depends on the full postgresql package, even though the same arguments could apply. \r\n\r\nI also note that I have recently put in a PR https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/9922, which is a different package for a similar Python PostgreSQL client. Other (currently non-spack) software require one or other of them, so it seemed easiest to keep them independent. \r\n",
