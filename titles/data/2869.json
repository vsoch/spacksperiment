    "body": "Resolves #1305\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to add a better testing framework for our Python packages. I see two low-hanging fruit that we can use for this:\r\n\r\n- [x] Run `python setup.py test` if available\r\n- [x] Try to import the Python module after installation\r\n\r\nMost Python modules (maybe only the ones that use setuptools?) implement some kind of a \"test\" command that can be run after \"build\" and before \"install\". This provides basic package tests, implemented by the developers.\r\n\r\nThe main thing holding this up is that we really need a \"test\" deptype (see #1279). For example, `py-setuptools` has no dependencies, aside from Python. But the test suite requires:\r\n```python\r\ntests_require=[                                                             \r\n    'setuptools[ssl]',                                                      \r\n    'pytest-flake8',                                                        \r\n    'pytest>=2.8',                                                          \r\n] + (['mock'] if sys.version_info[:2] < (3, 3) else []),     \r\n```\r\nI certainly don't want to add these as build dependencies, because they will make all package installations significantly more complex. I only want to build these dependencies if the user supplies `--run-tests`. And I don't want these dependencies included in the hash. `spack install --run-tests py-numpy` and `spack install py-numpy` should not be two separate installations.\r\n\r\nAs for the import tests after installation, do we want to always run these (like the sanity_check_prefix method), or only with `--run-tests`? Here is what I'm envisioning. By default, Spack tries to import the name of the packages minus the \"py-\". We will also need a method to override this. For example, the import name for `py-meep~mpi` is `meep`, but the import name for `py-meep+mpi` is `meep_mpi`. This will need to be tested on a per-package basis, but for the most part, dropping \"py-\" should give us the import name for most Python packages.",
