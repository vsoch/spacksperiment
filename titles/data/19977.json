    "body": "When trying to run an installation as a user that was switched to using `ksu`, Spack still determines the temp directory (set as `$tempdir/$user/spack-stage`) to be the $user from login, not the one switched to with `ksu`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ ksu new-user\r\n$ whoami\r\nnew-user\r\n$ spack python -c \"import spack.util.path as p; p.canonicalize_path('$tempdir/$user')\"\r\n'/tmp'\r\n$ python\r\n>>> import getpass\r\n>>> print(getpass.getuser())\r\nold-user\r\n>>> import pwd\r\n>>> print pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid())\r\npwd.struct_passwd(pw_name='new-user', pw_passwd='x', pw_uid=#####, pw_gid=#####, pw_gecos='<info>', pw_dir='/home/new-user', pw_shell='/bin/bash')\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nNo error message, per se.  Just the fact that when building, the build stage ends up under `~/.spack`, which in the case of our HPC machines is an NFS mounted filesystem and causes the builds to be very slow, especially for expansive Spack Stacks installations.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.3\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-broadwell\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [ ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n",
