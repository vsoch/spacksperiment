However, Sphinx doesn't like the fact that the target names are duplicated and issues the following warning message:\n\n```\nbasic_usage.rst:4: WARNING: Duplicate explicit target name: \"environment modules\".\n```\n\nThis bug was discovered in #1576 by adding documentation testing. It will be fixed in #1576. This issue is being opened to track the problem.\n",
