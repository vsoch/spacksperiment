    "body": "<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2. Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\nThe virtualgl package lists a virtual dependency on 'jpeg', which has providers libjpeg and libjpeg-turbo.   However, virtualgl seems to only be able to build with libjpeg-turbo.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install virtualgl ^libturbo\r\n```\r\nfails with errors like \r\n```console\r\nCMake Error at cmakescripts/FindTurboJPEG.cmake:16 (message):\r\n  Could not find turbojpeg.h in /opt/libjpeg-turbo/include.  If it is\r\n  installed in a different place, then set TJPEG_INCLUDE_DIR accordingly.\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  CMakeLists.txt:311 (include)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBulding against libjpeg-turbo, e.g.\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install virtualgl ^libturbo-jpeg\r\n```\r\nis successful.\r\n\r\nI made a quick attempt to hack the package.py to set TJPEG_INCLUDE_DIR and TJPEG_LIBRARY to point to the libjpeg include and libraries, but this still generates errors:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n    65    -- X Video support disabled (VGL_USEXV = 0)\r\n  >> 66    CMake Error at cmakescripts/FindTurboJPEG.cmake:16 (message):\r\n     67      Could not find turbojpeg.h in\r\n     68      /software/spack-software/2020.05.14/linux-rhel8-ivybridge/gcc-8.4.0/libjpeg-9c-5upfo56ajuvhkiw5krysf43w3jgzzcy4/include.\r\n     69      If it is installed in a different place, then set TJPEG_INCLUDE_DIR\r\n```\r\nsince of course libjpeg does not have a turbojpeg.h include.\r\n\r\nA simple solution would be to change the dependency from a virtual dependency on jpeg to a concrete dependency on libjpeg-turbo.   A better solution would be to patch the virtualgl build stuff to accept either libjpeg or libjpeg-turbo, but that is more work than I can deal with right now.  I am not sure if other packages have similar issues.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-ivybridge\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
