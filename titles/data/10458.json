Input 'SPACK_ENV_PATH' is missing.\r\nwinegcc: $SPACK_ROOT/lib/spack/env/gcc/g++ failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter a brief search of wine's build documentation, I don't think they provide an option to use one compiler for building wine, and a different one for `winegcc` afterwards.\r\n\r\nIs there a way of getting all of the spack compiler environment variables at recipe time? I think a wrapper around winegcc/wineg++ that sets those would be the easiest solution here.",
