Eg: if I say `spack uninstall openmpi foobar`, it should tell me that `foobar` is not a valid package name, and NOT uninstall `openmpi`.\n2. It should give a summary of what's going to happen  before it does the uninstalls; and (optionally) ask you interactively to confirm.\n3. There should be a --recursive option that goes on an uninstall spree.\n",
