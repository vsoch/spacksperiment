    "body": "This PR should fix #2466 and without touching a lot of code. The basic ideas:\r\n\r\n- directives now are lazy, and used just to capture the values passed to them\r\n- a list of commands stemming from directives gets stored in the class being created\r\n- these commands are executed at `Meta.__init__` time if the class being created comes from a package repository (if not it's just code that has been factored into a common base)\r\n\r\nThis also means that `DictWrapper` and `inspect.stack` are not used anymore, as we defer code execution to a later time where `pkg` is already available. ~*Currently this PR supports only single inheritance*~\r\n\r\n##### Modifications\r\n\r\n- [x] directives can be inherited \r\n- [x] multiple inheritance of base classes containing directives is supported\r\n- [x] tests that stress the new functionality",
