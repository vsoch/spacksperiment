    "body": "A newcomer to spack here, so sorry in advance if this is a dumb question :)\r\n\r\nWhen I install e.g. `vim`, I know I can then put the binary on my PATH (the manpage on the MANPATH, etc.) with `spack load vim`. But is there a preferred/recommended way to do this permanently and for multiple packages, so that I don't have to do this manually each time I want to use them? Or should I just roll my own solution (e.g. symlinking the files installed under `spack/opt/spack/` to directories which are already on my `PATH`, `MANPATH` etc.)?\r\n\r\nI'm not in the HPC trade, I'm looking for an alternative to Linuxbrew, which I just spent a whole afternoon in frustration trying to install on an older Ubuntu system. So far, `spack` seems to do a much better job at coping with older compilers and generally \"weird\" environments, all the `install` commands have been painless. The only missing piece of the puzzle is how to put the packages permanently on the `PATH`, `MANPATH` etc.\r\n\r\nI realize my use case for `spack` is somewhat atypical, so there may be no \"standard\" way of doing this. But if there is, could someone please point me to the place in the docs where this is explained? Thank you very much :)",
