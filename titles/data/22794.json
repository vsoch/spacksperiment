Currently there is only version 0.8 available in Spack.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nHere is a corresponding PR #22770. The proposed changes have been tested on my local PC (x86, ubuntu 18.04)\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ x ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [ x ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
