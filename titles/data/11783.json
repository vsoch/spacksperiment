    "body": "As discussed during today's BoF, some people would like Spack to use Python 3 if available. Since we cannot depend on any version of Python being available on all systems, this needs a slightly complex approach: The spack binary is moved to spack-real and replaced by a shell script that checks for available versions of Python (preferring Python 3) and invokes spack-real accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis should also take care of the situation where no python binary is available (as will be on RHEL 8 by default).\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is really the best way to go but I have been meaning to take a stab at this for a while now. (Only tested on Linux.)\r\n@tgamblin @alalazo @becker33 @adamjstewart",
