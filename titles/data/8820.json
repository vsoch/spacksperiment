Ordinarily, I would write a separate package for BLOPEX, but looking at the SLEPc BLOPEX repo https://bitbucket.org/joseroman/blopex, it appears that \"standalone BLOPEX\" is pretty sparsely documented, and even the project README recommends using it from either hypre or SLEPc, so it doesn't seem worth writing a separate `blopex` spack package.",
