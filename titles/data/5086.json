    "body": "I'm migrating our current ```spack``` version from one from march to a current one. While doing that I'm going to open PR's for a couple of things that should be upstream. Most of these will be new packages of different versions of existing ones. This one is a bit different:\r\n\r\nIt adds hook-magic for node-js files. This seems to have caused problems with ```py-jupyter-notebook``` at some point in history. However I didn't run into problems when installing our software stack even without it, feel free to close this if you prefer it not to be merged.",
