    "body": "ngspice, currently a dependency to package kicad, was only made as a library.\r\nAdded the option to make a bin with the variant build=bin, letting build=lib being the default.\r\nAdded options cider and xspice. Now fft is an option, we may use fftw or any compatible api (such as MKL).\r\nAdded option X for the binary, as well as readline.\r\nAdded adms feature when compiling against the git master.\r\nChecked compilation against nvhpc-21.3, Intel 2021, and gcc. Conflicts are set for old gcc with recent ngspice.\r\nCompilation line is made visible for easier error checks in compilation. OpenMP option is made available.\r\nAdded @aweits as a maintainer since kicad needs it.",
