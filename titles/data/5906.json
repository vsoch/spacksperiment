    "body": "The problem is that spack passes -G \"Unix Makefiles\" into cmake, which normally\r\nworks. But in the Exodus package, it is being passed into a bash wrapper\r\nscript. In there, the $@ then loses the information about \"Unix Makefiles\"\r\nbeing just one argument, and in effect passes -G Unix Makefiles into the cmake\r\n(without quotes), and so cmake only sees -G Unix, and then fails. This is a\r\nknown problem with bash with no simple solutions. As a workaround, this patch\r\nskips the first two arguments, i.e., -G and \"Unix Makefiles\". This makes it\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nFixes #5895.",
