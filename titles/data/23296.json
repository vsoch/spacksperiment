That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install gcc @10.3.0 +graphite %apple-clang @12.0.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis builds GCC with the Apple Clang compiler shipped with macOS 11.3. The previous version was 12.0.0, which worked fine for building GCC.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2404-303e506f2b\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-bigsur-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt.gz](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6387605/spack-build-out.txt.gz)\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6387598/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures.
