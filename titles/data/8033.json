    "body": "I have a bash script which goes through  a set of sepcs, installs them and runs tests. Key parts are:\r\n```\r\nspack install --keep-stage \"$s\"\r\nspack cd -s \"$s\"\r\ncd <build-folder>\r\nspack env \"$s\" bash << EOF\r\nctest <parameters>\r\nEOF\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to improve this by not re-installing the spec, but rather check if it's installed already, and if so, in the stage I kept outside of system temporary directories I would just do `git pull` to update the sources and `make all -j8` to re-build.\r\n\r\n`spack find <spec>` is the candidate, but I don't think it returns an error code to the bash. \r\nIdeally it should be something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nspec_installed = <something-with-spack-find>\r\nif [ \"${spec_installed}\" == \"1\" ]; then\r\n  git pull\r\n  make all\r\nelse\r\n  spack install --keep-stage \"$s\"$\r\nfi\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyone tried to do something similar with bash?",
