    "body": "Add Blast+ package.\r\n\r\nAdds support for NCBI's blast+@2.6.0.  I'll be adding a few historical versions in the near future.\r\n\r\nThis should be ready to go, in spite of the comments below.  It builds and runs as is, I'd like to get some real-users miles on it.\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly direct transliteration of the [Homebrew Science recipe][hbs].\r\n\r\n~I've applied the patch that homebrew uses, but as-I-found-it it didn't work.  Line 17 was `... find * ...` and I rewrote it to `... find . ...`.  I can't find any CVS or .svn dirs anywhere in the tree, so it probably doesn't matter but it was generating an error (which was ignored, but...) at the tail end of the build.~  Edit: I've updated the patch to comment out the block.  It doesn't appear to be relevant (no .svn dirs to be found...) and it wasn't running successfully as written.\r\n\r\nI skipped the mysql support (for now?).\r\n\r\nThere is a problem with HDF5 support.  Blast's configure script test program defines a macro 'HOST' to a string value and one of the HDF5 bits has an variable named 'HOST'.  Fun things happen.   I've disabled support for now.\r\n\r\nI've run very basic tests.  I'll get this out to my users and ensure that it works and fine tune the options and etc....\r\n\r\n[hbs]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/blob/master/blast.rb",
