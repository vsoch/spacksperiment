The current help text says that you need to modify your .yaml files manually.\r\n\r\nWith `spack external find` we don't need to do this anymore.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack: 0.15.4-1006-e5cc37b71\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n",
