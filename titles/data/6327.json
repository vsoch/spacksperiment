    "body": "Fixes #518 \r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nPreviously, when there were multiple names for a compiler, Spack chose the name that occurs first lexicographically as it searches the directory. This caused problems for the PGI compiler, for which we should choose `pgfortran` when available over `pgf77` and `pgf90`.\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart proposed in #518 that a reasonable solution would be to choose compilers in the order they appear in the compiler_names list in Spack. This allows us to set priorities for compiler names using the compiler subclasses in Spack.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements that solution, and adds a test for it. Also adds a test to ensure Spack chooses the first compiler of a given version in the paths provided to `spack compiler add`.",
