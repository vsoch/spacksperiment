    "body": "### Rationale\r\n\r\nDuring a build, spack provides summary of the build times, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Successfully installed cmake\r\n  Fetch: 1.18s.  Build: 58.42s.  Total: 59.60s.\r\n```\r\nIt would be great if these times were also stored along with other info (spack-build-env.txt spack-build-out.txt\tspec.yaml) that is kept in the  special `.spack` dir created during the install.\r\n\r\nThis would allow folks to traverse the builds and extract this info easily after the fact.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n~~- [ ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack~~\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
