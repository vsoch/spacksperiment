Stop. \r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure is charm++ architecture is now per one installed package or it still can combine multiple within single installed package. So  I added conditional patching if there is no spec['charmpp'].charmarch in spec['charmpp'].prefix then set CHARM to $(CHARMBASE) in Make.config.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nNikolay",
