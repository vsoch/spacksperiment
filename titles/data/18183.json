This allows spack to make use of those.\r\n\r\nIt also fixes a bug (reported by @rblake on slack) with cmake externals on macos for users who set their default compiler to gcc. Previously, those users would get concretization every time a package depended on cmake, because the default cmake was %gcc, which is a conflict on macos.",
