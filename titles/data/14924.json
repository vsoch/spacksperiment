Intel provides the old names for compatibility, so\r\nit looked like the old names were correct.  :-(\r\n\r\nThe contents of the two tar files (2020_U1.tar.gz and v2020.1.tar.gz)\r\nare identical except for the top-level directory name.  But that's\r\nenough to change the sha sum.\r\n\r\nBetter to adapt sooner rather than later I guess.\r\n\r\nping @tgamblin who reviewed the previous commit",
