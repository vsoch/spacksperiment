    "body": "This changes makes sure that when we run the pipeline job that updates\r\nthe buildcache package index on the remote mirror, we also update the\r\nkey index.  The public keys corresponding to the signing keys used to\r\nsign the package was pushed to the mirror as a part of creating the\r\nbuildcache index, so this is just ensuring those keys are reflected\r\nin the key index.\r\n\r\nAlso, this change makes sure the \"spack buildcache update-index\"\r\njob runs even when there may have been pipeline failures, since we\r\nwould like the index always to reflect the true state of the mirror.",
