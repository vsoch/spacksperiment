    "body": "I'm finding that CMake since version 3.10.0 has changed their implementation of `FindMPI.cmake` and it is causing problems with packages that I know use `FindMPI` such as `tioga`, `openfast`, and `nalu-wind`. You can see the error the new `FindMPI.cmake` causes and the issue I created for it here https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/issues/18448 . You can find another instance where someone else was experiencing this issue as well here https://github.com/Exawind/nalu-wind/issues/39 .\r\n\r\nTherefore, I have created this patch while I wait for a resolution from Kitware. I have verified that it builds `tioga`, `open-fast`, and `nalu-wind` and builds everything and runs our tests correctly using this patch and CMake 3.12.3.",
