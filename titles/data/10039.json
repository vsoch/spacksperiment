    "body": "Fixed issue #7372 with building fftw@2\r\n\r\nAdded patch method which renames config.h in the fftw subdir of the source tree.  fftw 2.1.5 appears to ship with a copy of this file with all defines commented out.  This gets read by the #include directives instead of the version in the build directory with the correct defines.  As a result, many C preprocessor macros left undefined, including F77_FUNC_ which causes the bulk of fttwf77.c to be skipped due to an #ifdef, so fftw_reverse_int_array et al not included in library.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed some inconsistencies with the handling of quad and long_double in specs between the configure method and the build, check, and install methods.",
