We will still associate Spack versions with each tutorial instance, but we need to have many tutorials for each Spack version, and we'd like to preserve all the tutorial versions.\r\n\r\nThe new tutorial site is already up and running, and you can see the repo and submit PRs to it at https://github.com/spack/spack-tutorial.\r\n\r\n@hauten: FYI.",
