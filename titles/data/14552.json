Happy to resubmit, if needed.\r\n\r\nNote that I have contributed to the upstream casacore package in the past, and I'm currently working on fixes to issues in the casacore build for which I've put in place workarounds in this PR. I hope to be able to follow up with another PR for the casacore package once the upstream is fixed.",
