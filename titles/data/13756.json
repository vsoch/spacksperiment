    "body": "With a recent update I noticed that Spack was not seeing previously installed packages. I then also noticed that Spack would install packages to the wrong directory. Essentially, Spack is ignoring the configuration information that states where packages **should** be installed and instead is looking at the default install directory. Using `git bisect` the commit that introduced the issue is 43b0356e14a8227f33040302cf948d3c98508d59, #13725.
