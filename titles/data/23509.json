Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install py-matplotlib%clang\r\n  >> 582    clang-12: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to \r\n            see invocation)\r\n  >> 583    error: command '/scratch/dsjense/spack/lib/spack/env/clang/clang++'\r\n             failed with exit status 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\nThis fails to build on RHEL7, Ubuntu 18, and Ubuntu 20 with Clang > 10\r\n```\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2490-5a747b9\r\n* **Python:** 2.7.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-ivybridge\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n@adamjstewart \r\n[This forum post](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/5787) suggested turning off link-time optimization when using Clang.  I created a branch with a possible fix [here](https://github.com/dsjense/spack/tree/matplotlib-clang-lto).  I'm not sure if this affects all versions of Clang but I definitely had problems with llvm@10,12.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt]()\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt]()\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
