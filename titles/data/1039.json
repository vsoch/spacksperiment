    "body": "- Register 'tk' variant (default=False so existing behavior is unmodified).\n- Add dependencies on tcl and tk if +tk in found in the spec.\n- Add configure options to enable discovery of Tcl/Tk during the python build.\n- Update formatting to meet flake8 requirements:\n  - Mostly this involved splitting long lines and removing extra blank lines. I\n    did have a little trouble with E125 and E129 (continuation line does not\n    distinguish itself from the next logical line). In the end, I added an extra\n    set of parenthesis so that the continuation line indent didn't line up\n    exactly with the conditional body.\n- Fixes #1024\n",
