    "body": "@balay I would like to remove xsdk 0.2.0 because the existence of special \"xsdk\" versions complicates version specifications for packages that expect a linear progression of version numbers. (For instance, `trilinos@:11.0` concretizes on develop to `trilinos@xsdk-0.2.0`.) Currently xsdk@0.2.0 won't even install due to missing hypre packages and disabled xsdktrilinos.\r\n\r\nThis also removes the unused `xsdktrilinos` package -- referenced only in a commented-out line in xsdk, and an inactive github project for four years.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/17145 .",
