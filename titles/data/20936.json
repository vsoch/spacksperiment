    "body": "<!-- Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\nExample: \"I ran `spack find` to list all the installed packages and ...\" -->\r\n\r\nAs stated in the documentation user level configurations should take precedence over site level configurations. I have run into slightly unexpected behavior, where I have a variant which I want to set for all my packages in my user config, and this seems to not be applied to packages which have variants defined in the site level config.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nIn more concrete terms:\r\n`~/.spack/linux/packages.yaml` contains:\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  all:\r\n    compiler: [gcc@8.3.0]\r\n    variants: cxxstd=17\r\n```\r\nand the site level config in `$(prefix)/etc/spack/packages.yaml` contains:\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  geant4:\r\n    variants: ~qt~opengl+vecgeom\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I would have expected that the default concretized spec I get for `geant4` would be something along the lines of `geant4 ~qt~opengl+vecgeom cxxstd=17`, but instead I get the following:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nspack spec geant4\r\n```\r\n```\r\nInput spec\r\n--------------------------------\r\ngeant4\r\n\r\nConcretized\r\n--------------------------------\r\ngeant4@10.7.0%gcc@8.3.0~ipo~motif~opengl~python~qt+threads+vecgeom~x11 build_type=RelWithDebInfo cxxstd=11 arch=linux-centos7-haswell\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, the `cxxstd=17` variant from my user level configuration is not applied on top of the sit level configuration, but instead the default `cxxstd=11` is used. Is this the intended behavior? I.e. is \"adding\" user level configuration for `all` packages to site level configuration of specific packages not possible? I would have naively expected that this should work.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n```console\r\nspack debug report\r\n```\r\n```\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-656-330c48b\r\n* **Python:** 2.7.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-haswell\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor completeness:\r\n```console\r\nspack config get packages\r\n```\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n  all:\r\n    compiler: [gcc@8.3.0, gcc, intel, pgi, clang, xl, nag, fj, aocc]\r\n    variants: cxxstd=17\r\n    providers:\r\n      D: [ldc]\r\n      awk: [gawk]\r\n      blas: [openblas, amdblis]\r\n      daal: [intel-daal]\r\n      elf: [elfutils]\r\n      fftw-api: [fftw, amdfftw]\r\n      gl: [mesa+opengl, mesa18, opengl]\r\n      glx: [mesa+glx, mesa18+glx, opengl]\r\n      glu: [mesa-glu, openglu]\r\n      golang: [gcc]\r\n      iconv: [libiconv]\r\n      ipp: [intel-ipp]\r\n      java: [openjdk, jdk, ibm-java]\r\n      jpeg: [libjpeg-turbo, libjpeg]\r\n      lapack: [openblas, amdlibflame]\r\n      mariadb-client: [mariadb-c-client, mariadb]\r\n      mkl: [intel-mkl]\r\n      mpe: [mpe2]\r\n      mpi: [openmpi, mpich]\r\n      mysql-client: [mysql, mariadb-c-client]\r\n      opencl: [pocl]\r\n      osmesa: [mesa+osmesa, mesa18+osmesa]\r\n      pil: [py-pillow]\r\n      pkgconfig: [pkgconf, pkg-config]\r\n      rpc: [libtirpc]\r\n      scalapack: [netlib-scalapack, amdscalapack]\r\n      sycl: [hipsycl]\r\n      szip: [libszip, libaec]\r\n      tbb: [intel-tbb]\r\n      unwind: [libunwind]\r\n      yacc: [bison, byacc]\r\n      flame: [libflame, amdlibflame]\r\n      uuid: [util-linux-uuid, libuuid]\r\n    permissions:\r\n      read: world\r\n      write: user\r\n  geant4:\r\n    variants: ~qt~opengl+vecgeom\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue.
