    "body": "Add configure arguments that specify the location of the tcl and tk config scripts.\r\n\r\nTested on Centos7 w/ the system gcc (4.8.x) on a DO droplet.  Both with and without X build.  `capabilities(\"tcltk\")` is `true` for both.  Even when configured with `+X`, `capabilities(\"X11\")` is only true if `DISPLAY` is set (a valid X session).\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely certain of the current R, X, Tk, Linux, and MacOS subtleties, so this would benefit from a review by someone who is.\r\n\r\nFixes #7072 \r\n",
