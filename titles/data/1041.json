    "body": "This is an overhaul of the Matplotlib Python package. I noticed that half of its dependencies were missing and half of the dependencies listed aren't actually dependencies. As a start, I only included dependencies listed in the [Matplotlib installation instructions](http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html#build-requirements).\n\nFor some reason I can't get most of the `+gui` dependencies to build, so someone may need to help me on that. Some of the non-documented dependencies that I removed may actually be important (is py-nose important for testing?) so if you think I removed something that needs to be there just let me know.\n",
