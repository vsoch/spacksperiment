    "body": "I discovered several places in `version.py` where we were checking to see if a version evaluated as True when we really meant to check if a version is not None.\r\n\r\nFor example, `VersionRange(2, 1)` raised an \"Invalid version range\" ValueError, but `VersionRange(2, 0)` did not. Also, during string conversion, `VersionRange(0, 0)` and `VersionRange(None, None)` were equivalent.\r\n\r\nFrom PEP-8:\r\n\r\n> Comparisons to singletons like None should always be done with is or is not, never the equality operators.\r\n> \r\n> Also, beware of writing if x when you really mean if x is not None -- e.g. when testing whether a variable or argument that defaults to None was set to some other value. The other value might have a type (such as a container) that could be false in a boolean context!",
