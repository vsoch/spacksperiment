Participation simply means adding your name to the pledge, and then (optionally) adding a badge to any associated project repos.\r\n\r\nDetails are provided at the page, and any spack maintainers / users here are welcome to also join the organization [The Good Labs](https://www.github.com/good-labs) if open source transparency is important to them. It's still early (I'm going to be creating media and other community interactions) and right now I'm getting in touch with projects that I've worked with.\r\n",
