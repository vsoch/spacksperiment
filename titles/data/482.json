    "body": "Spack current lacks build dependencies --- dependencies that are required at build-time, but not later when a package is used.  CMake is a common example.\n\nProposal:\n1. Add build_depends_on(), which works just like depends_on(), but specifies build dependencies.  For version 1, build_depends_on() can be an alias for depends_on().\n2. When things are specified from build_depends_on(), don't put them in the module file, and other places where build dependencies are not needed.\n",
