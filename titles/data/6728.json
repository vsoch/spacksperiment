    "body": "Fix for #6698. The patch needs to be applied to additional versions. The sqlite community had a fix in https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/b9a58daca80a815e, which should have made it into the 3.19.0 version, but a subsequent change in https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/17e0bb12d82b510b did not carry over that change. Hopefully this will get resolved in the next sqlite release, so I am optimistically only applying the patch through the current latest version of sqlite.",
