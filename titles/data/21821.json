    "body": "Replace intel-oneapi-compilers with intel-oneapi-cpp and intel-oneapi-fortran. Setup the runtime environment using the setvars instead of manually setting variables. Compilers were coming from hpckit, now they are installed from the standalones. This addresses the following issues:\r\n\r\n* FPGA emulation support and dev-utilities (includes dpc_common.hpp) were missing\r\n* environment was not fully setup for people using spack load\r\n* compiler standalones are released more often than hpckit and could not be installed with intel-oneapi-compilers\r\n\r\naddresses:\r\n#21724 \r\n#21698 \r\n\r\nPlease review: @frankwillmore @glennpj @scheibelp ",
