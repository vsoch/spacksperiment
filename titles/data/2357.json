We had a package that did not change versions but did change checksums. (Lets not dwell on this - obviously it's not ideal but it happened and it was out of our control).\r\n\r\nSo, we updated our package.py with the new checksum.  \r\n\r\nEach time we build we attempt to update our mirror.  When doing so, spack found the old tarball (recall the version number didn't change) and moved on.  \r\n\r\nThen during the build phase the checksum verify failed. The only way to resolve this was to manually  remove the tarball. \r\n\r\nDoes spack now use checksums during the mirroring process? If not, is it something we can discuss?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
