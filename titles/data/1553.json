    "body": "Fixes #1552. This was causing errors like:\n\n```\n$ spack spec netcdf ^hdf5@1.8.16\nInput spec\n------------------------------\n  netcdf\n      ^hdf5\n\nNormalized\n------------------------------\n==> Error: netcdf does not depend on hdf5\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n$ spack spec netcdf+mpi ^mvapich2\nInput spec\n------------------------------\n  netcdf+mpi\n      ^mvapich2\n\nNormalized\n------------------------------\n==> Error: netcdf does not depend on mvapich2\n```\n\nHere's my understanding of the problem. @tgamblin can correct me if I'm wrong. During normalization, variants are ignored unless explicitly stated. So `netcdf+mpi ^hdf5` and `netcdf~mpi ^hdf5` work but `netcdf ^hdf5` doesn't. Also, versions are ignored during normalization unless explicitly stated. So `netcdf@4.4.1+mpi ^mvapich2` and `netcdf@4.4.0+mpi ^mvapich2` work but `netcdf+mpi ^mvapich2` doesn't. This solution spreads all of the constraints out so that they do not interfere. Obviously dependency resolution is a little bit broken if mpi defaults to true but netcdf doesn't depend on mpi, but that's another issue that's been well documented.\n",
