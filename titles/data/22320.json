Instead of making the user create a spec by hand (basically\r\ntransforming all the rules in the environment manifest into a spec,\r\ndefying the purpose of the environment...), use the provided spec as a\r\nfilter for the already concretized specs. This also speeds up things,\r\ncause we don't have to reconcretize.\r\n\r\npinging @scheibelp and @becker33 \r\n",
