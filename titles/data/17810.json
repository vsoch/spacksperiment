    "body": "As far as I can tell this issue occurs when the system GNU compilers are more recent than 6.5.0. For a more comprehensive description of the problem see https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3/issues/184.\r\n\r\nIt can be worked-around by replacing the `-no-gcc` option set in the `configure` for Intel compilers by `-gcc-sys`:\r\n```\r\n-no-gcc     Undefines GNU macros.\r\n-gcc-sys    Defines GNU macros only during compilation of system headers.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be done easily in Spack (https://github.com/RemiLacroix-IDRIS/spack/commit/d2edb5f3571674c8724360018ca4f1d488a4806a):\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/blob/d2edb5f3571674c8724360018ca4f1d488a4806a/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/fftw/package.py#L105\r\n\r\nHowever I not completely sure of the side-effects it might have so I am hoping to get a more definitive answer on the FFTW issue.",
