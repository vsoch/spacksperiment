It was installing headers into `<prefix>/usr/include` and libraries into `<prefix>/usr/lib` instead of `<prefix>/include` and `<prefix>/lib`.  The extra level of `usr/` subdirectories causes dependent packages like libfabric to fail to build. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce, run the following on any x86 system (it does not need to have Omni-Path hardware present):\r\n\r\n`spack install libfabric fabrics=psm2`\r\n\r\nThe above command will fail due to lack of psm2 headers (or else mistakenly pick up system psm2 headers if present) unless the PR is applied.",
