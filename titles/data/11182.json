    "body": "The default (implied) behavior for all environments, as of https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/10017, is that an environment will maintain a view in a location of its choosing. #10017 explicitly recorded all three possible states of maintaining a view:\r\n\r\n1. Maintain a view, and let the environment decide where to put it (default)\r\n2. Maintain a view, and let the user decide\r\n3. Don't maintain a view\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the config writer so that for case [1], nothing will be written to the `config.yaml`. This will not change any existing behavior, it just serves to keep the config more compact (which ideally makes it more readable).",
