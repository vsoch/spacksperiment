The namespace is working as intended, I've already installed the specs!\r\n\r\nIs this supposed to work that way, am I doing something wrong or is this in reality a bug?\r\n\r\nEDIT: System info:\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2332-febeca2b05\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.3\r\n* **Platform:** linux-debian10-skylake_avx512\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n",
