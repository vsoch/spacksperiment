It makes it possible to understand if the list of paths that is provided to the method was given by users explicitly or they just expect the default behavior.\r\n\r\nFor example, this prevents Cnl class from looking for module files in directories that are listed in the $PATH when a user calls 'spack compiler find' without specifying additional paths.",
