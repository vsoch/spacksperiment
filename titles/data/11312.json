Since then, we have fixed several problems which were present at the time, and we have released the first version of our software (1.0.0). \r\nIn this PR, I hope to improve the spack Ginkgo package to reflect these changes.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n+ Fix a minor typo in the deal.II package.\r\n+ Version 1.0.0 was released and the master branch tracks\r\n   the latest release.\r\n+ Multiple issues with MacOS have been fixed.\r\n+ The static patch is now unneeded.\r\n+ Add support for building Ginkgo with the full Block Jacobi\r\n   performance (compilation takes a long time, so it's off by\r\n   default).\r\n+ Do not build any documentation, benchmarks, examples\r\n   and tests as they are not used at installation time.",
