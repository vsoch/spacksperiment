Deleted all\r\n  versions prior to v2.5.2.\r\n- Update homepage (looks like singularity's going Freemium).\r\n- Use release tarball instead of automagically generated archive\r\n  tarball (digest values are more stable).\r\n- No longer need autotools for released versions, just @devel.\r\n- Install needs to be single-threaded, otherwise when installed as\r\n  root the various 'chmod' operations race against the copies.\r\n\r\nCloses #8656 ",
