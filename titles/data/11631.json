    "body": "This will address a small error that the default perl is too old to support json-c. If the user hasn't installed anything with perl recently, it will trigger an error. The error was reported in #11613 which is closed, but the issue remains with the json-c package. The user fixed by installing 2.28, but I chose the earliest version of perl with a hash provided here. @ziya reported other issues with installing packages that depend on a newer version of perl, and (although he didn't share) these should also be looked into.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Vanessa Sochat <vsochat@stanford.edu>",
