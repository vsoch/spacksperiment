    "body": "Plasma installs correctly (in this instance as part of the xSDK but I've also installed individually) but I'm experiencing the following error when attempting to generate module files.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ spack module lmod refresh\r\n...\r\n\ufeff==> Regenerating lmod module files\r\n==> Warning: Could not write module file [/ecp/sw/dev/ecp-p9-4v100/modulefiles/xsdk/lmod/linux-centos7-ppc64le/netlib-lapack/3.8.0-er4hgnv/gcc/8.3.0/plasma/18.11.1.lua]\r\n==> Warning:    --> global name 'prefix' is not defined <--\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix appears to be using `self.prefix` instead of just `prefix` in the `cmake_args(self)` method. But if this is the wrong approach please let me know. Other posts relating to the \"is not defined\" error message did not help correct it.\r\n\r\n@luszczek hope you don't mind I tag you on this PR since your marked as the maintainer.",
