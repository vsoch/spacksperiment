    "body": "This commit fixes #7900.\r\n\r\nIn short: in the absence of constraints to the contrary, spack will\r\ndownload the preferred version of a package, which is usually the most\r\nrecent non-develop version. On a clean spack installation without\r\nhypre installed, `spack install mfem` will download hypre 2.14.0,\r\nwhich is API-incompatible with mfem 3.3.2 (and earlier versions of\r\nmfem), so spack will throw compiler errors re: the API mismatch.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes that error by restricting mfem release versions\r\n3.3.2 and earlier to hypre version 2.10.0 to 2.13.999 (only 2.13.0\r\ncurrently exists, but if it has a non-2.14.x maintenance release,\r\nthese versions of hypre should also be permitted).",
