It's actually NOT possible to compute statically\r\n    whether a Spec is concrete now.  The ONLY way you know is if it goes\r\n    through concretization and is marked concrete once that completes.\r\n  - This commit removes all simple concreteness checks and relies only on\r\n    the _concrete attribute.  This should make thinking about\r\n    concreteness simpler.\r\n\r\n- [x] Fixed a couple places where Specs need to be marked concrete explicitly.\r\n  - Specs read from files and Specs that are destructively copied from\r\n    concrete Specs now need to be marked concrete explicitly.\r\n  - These spots may previously have \"worked\", but they were brittle and\r\n    should be explcitly marked anyway.\r\n\r\n- [x] Fixed bug - `_dup()` and `_dup_deps()` that would lose cached \r\n   concreteness of dependencies.\r\n",
