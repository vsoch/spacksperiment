    "body": "Now that we have the X11 stuff (yay @adamjstewart !) I'm working from a base image that does not include any of the X libraries.\n\nI'm discovering things that need X (_tk_, _R_).  The simple fix is just to toss in `depends_on('libx11')` and get on with it.\n\nBefore I submit the couple of trivial PR's, does the Spack community want to \"force\" people to use Spack's X stuff?  There aren't that many things in the tree that depend on _libx11_ that aren't also part of the X world, it makes sense that they all depend on it unconditionally.  The only non-X-thingy example I can find is sublime text, which also depends on it unconditionally.  Is that the way we want to go?  What about people who want/need to use their system's libraries?\n\nCan someone remind me (I'm rusty...) what the spec for R would look like to ensure that its dependencies used a particular variant.  Do I need to know that R _depends_on_ Tk which (soon) _depends_on_ libx11?\n",
