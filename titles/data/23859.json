    "body": "There's a circular dependency where clang of llvm-amdgpu needs bitcode of rocm-device-libs, but rocm-device-libs needs llvm-amdgpu to compile.\r\n\r\nAMD has written a piece of code that special-cases spack in the way they detect the bitcode from clang, and it's flawed. See https://reviews.llvm.org/D97340.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes that part redundant by building rocm-device-libs as an LLVM external project as part of llvm-amdgpu, using spack's `resource` to pull in the the device lib sources.\r\n\r\nIt also removes `rocm-device-libs` from the deps of some packages, which I believe was redundant already before this pr.\r\n\r\nApart from that it fixes some issues in packages that slipped through review (e.g. unused `self.define_from_variant(...)`), cleans a couple things up, and adds myself as maintainer to package I frequently use.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR is on top of #23855.\r\n\r\nPing @srekolam, @arjun-raj-kuppala ",
