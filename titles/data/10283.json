    "body": "I am attempting to restrict versions of a given package, r3d, in my `packages.yaml` file, and in doing so, Spack is throwing the following error:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack spec r3d\r\nInput spec\r\n--------------------------------\r\nr3d\r\n\r\nConcretized\r\n--------------------------------\r\n==> Error: <unknown file>: datetime.date(2018, 12, 19) is not valid under any of the given schemas\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to be entirely related to the \"date\" format of the actual package version, \"2018-12-19\" during concretization.
