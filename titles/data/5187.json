    "body": "While building a few packages in a minimal chroot, I noticed that autoconf and automake are missing a perl dependency. When adding it, a few of the tools fail because the shebang is too long, so we have to fix those up. We also have to remove `-w` from the shebang because of https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/14887/the-way-to-use-usr-bin-env-sed-f-in-shebang. Fun times.\r\n\r\nThis also seems to fix #3719 for me (Fedora 26).",
