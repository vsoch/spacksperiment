    "body": "Fixes #7016.\r\n\r\nIn GCC 7, `-dumpversion` was changed to return the major version, not the full version. Use `-dumpfullversion` to get around this. This change was already made for `gcc` and `g++` in #6111, but not for `gfortran`, resulting in the issue reported in #7016. This PR fixes that.\r\n\r\nTested on:\r\n\r\n- [x] macOS 10.13.2 with GCC 7.2.0\r\n- [x] CentOS 6.9 with GCC 4.4.7\r\n- [x] CentOS 7.4 with GCC 4.8.5\r\n- [x] Ubuntu 17.10 with GCC 4.8, 5.4.1, 6.4.0, and 7.2.0\r\n\r\n@hfp ",
