    "body": "This PR is a follow up of #8612 and an alternative implementation of the improved import capabilities in #11145.\r\n\r\nThe problem with #8612 was basically that for complex commands one couldn't split source code into python modules that were residing:\r\n1. In the extension root folder \r\n2. In a subfolder of the `cmd` directory\r\n\r\nThis PR solves that issue by ensuring that, for each extension found, the python packages associated with the root folder and the `cmd` folder are in `sys.modules` with an appropriate `__path__` set.\r\n\r\nList of modifications:\r\n- [x] Spack extensions can import code from modules in root or cmd folder (either relative or absolute imports)\r\n- [x] Added unit tests to verify this behavior",
