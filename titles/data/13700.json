Putting the directives in a file cleans up `package.py` and puts the dependencies in a nice, human readable, and version controllable form.\r\n\r\n## What's next\r\n\r\nI have not added tests, documentation, examples, etc.  If this feature will be useful and the PR has a chance of being merged, I will add any additional items necessary.",
