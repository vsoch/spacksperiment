    "body": "I'm making this a new issue since it is a basic design question, not specific to an individual package. \n\nSay there is a package Y that depends on PETSc but needs some small additions to the PETSc that gets provided (for example an added dependency on spai). Now I could copy the petsc.py (call it petsc+spai.py) and add an additional line with the extra dependency and have my users use petsc+spai.py instead of petsc.py   The drawback is that overtime fixes etc may be made in petsc.py that don't get made into my custom petsc+spai.py. \n\nSo, is there, or could there be a concept of \"including\" a previous xxx.py into a new xxx+yyy.py to use the information from both files in building the package? This way people can in a very light weight manner provide \"custom\" builds without the high overhead and danger of duplicate code. \n",
