    "body": "Hello!\n\nIs anyone else getting complaints about the `which` helper not being defined in build_environment.py? I am getting this when trying to build anything with the latest develop (e41d67e031aca9acabca) on Cray systems, but not on civilized systems.\n\n```\nRobert.French@gaea9 ~/Projects/spack $ spack install libpng %gcc@4.3.4 arch=cray_xc-SuSE11-ivybridge\n==> Installing libpng\n==> zlib is already installed in /autofs/mnt/ncrc-svm1_home1/Robert.French/Projects/spack/opt/spack/cray_xc-SuSE11-ivybridge/gcc-4.3.4/zlib-1.2.8-jblztzcconqyhj6bigfz4bh453zrjgoz\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/autofs/mnt/ncrc-svm1_home1/Robert.French/Projects/spack/bin/spack\", line 179, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"/autofs/mnt/ncrc-svm1_home1/Robert.French/Projects/spack/bin/spack\", line 157, in main\n    return_val = command(parser, args)\n  File \"/autofs/mnt/ncrc-svm1_home1/Robert.French/Projects/spack/lib/spack/spack/cmd/install.py\", line 82, in install\n    explicit=True)\n  File \"/autofs/mnt/ncrc-svm1_home1/Robert.French/Projects/spack/lib/spack/spack/package.py\", line 997, in do_install\n    spack.build_environment.fork(self, build_process)\n  File \"/autofs/mnt/ncrc-svm1_home1/Robert.French/Projects/spack/lib/spack/spack/build_environment.py\", line 491, in fork\n    setup_package(pkg)\n  File \"/autofs/mnt/ncrc-svm1_home1/Robert.French/Projects/spack/lib/spack/spack/build_environment.py\", line 431, in setup_package\n    set_build_environment_variables(pkg, spack_env)\n  File \"/autofs/mnt/ncrc-svm1_home1/Robert.French/Projects/spack/lib/spack/spack/build_environment.py\", line 292, in set_build_environment_variables\n    load_module(pkg.spec.architecture.target.module_name)\n  File \"/autofs/mnt/ncrc-svm1_home1/Robert.French/Projects/spack/lib/spack/spack/build_environment.py\", line 123, in load_module\n    modulecmd = which('modulecmd')\nNameError: name 'which' is not defined\n==> Error: Installation process had nonzero exit code : 256\n```\n\nIt looks like build_environment.py:123 definitely invokes `which` without first importing it from `spack.util.executable`. I reckon this route through the code only gets used on Crays?\n",
