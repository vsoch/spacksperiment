    "body": "The `.lock` file created in the staging area doesn't seem to be used.  In my specific scenario we have a virtualized head node, so we are using `qsub` to submit installation jobs.  There's a shared filesystem, some voodoo, etc.\r\n\r\nThis specific use case is obtuse (I wish I could do it directly via `ssh`...), but is analogous to a shared filesystem across servers that have the same `spack` managing each other.\r\n\r\n1. I farm out a job compiling `openmpi %gcc@7.2.0`.  Suppose this is PID `A` on Node `B`.\r\n2. A lock file `.lock` in my staging directory is made, stating `pid=A,host=B` has the lock.\r\n3. I farm out a job compiling `openblas %gcc@7.2.0`.  Suppose this is PID `X` on Node `Y`.\r\n4. The `.lock`is deleted, and now states `pid=X,host=Y`.\r\n\r\nSolution (?)  Create a `.lock` on the package being compiled, not the staging directory.\r\n\r\nP.S. Regardless of the locking system, this hasn't seemed to prevent me from installing anything.  It did once catch it trying to install a dependency that was currently being compiled elsewhere, but there was one time (I think) that it did not.\r\n\r\n**Update**: in trying to understand a different error, I (somehow just NOW) learned of the formidable `spack -d` feature.  It seems there is a **lot** more going on with locking than meets the eye:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> READ LOCK: /home/sjm324/.spack/cache/providers/.builtin-index.yaml.lock[0:0] [Acquiring]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /home/sjm324/.spack/cache/providers/.builtin-index.yaml.lock[0:0] [Acquired]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /home/sjm324/.spack/cache/providers/.builtin-index.yaml.lock[0:0] [Released]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[8903578251265676733:1] [Acquiring]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[8903578251265676733:1] [Acquired]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/lock[0:0] [Acquiring]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/lock[0:0] [Acquired]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/lock[0:0] [Released]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[8903578251265676733:1] [Released]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[8903578251265676733:1] [Acquiring]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[8903578251265676733:1] [Acquired]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[8903578251265676733:1] [Released]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[3131744984018514903:1] [Acquiring]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[3131744984018514903:1] [Acquired]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[3131744984018514903:1] [Released]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[3131744984018514903:1] [Acquiring]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[3131744984018514903:1] [Acquired]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[3131744984018514903:1] [Released]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/var/spack/stage/.lock[532956495437800316:1] [Acquiring]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/var/spack/stage/.lock[532956495437800316:1] [Acquired]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[8903578251265676733:1] [Acquiring]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[8903578251265676733:1] [Acquired]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/lock[0:0] [Acquiring]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/lock[0:0] [Acquired]\r\n==> READ LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/lock[0:0] [Released]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[8903578251265676733:1] [Released]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/var/spack/stage/.lock[532956495437800316:1] [Released]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/lock[0:0] [Acquiring]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/lock[0:0] [Acquired]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /share/apps/spack/spack_all/opt/spack/.spack-db/lock[0:0] [Released]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still stand by the initial suggestion, though.  Either\r\n\r\n1. The locks don't actually do anything (hence why I can `qsub` multiple packages at once and they install correctly).\r\n2. I really don't understand what is actually being locked here.\r\n\r\nLocking the specific package being compiled seems to make sense, but definitely feel free to close this if I'm missing the point.  I just sort of observed this, and thought I'd point out the locks may not be doing all they are supposed to.  I have no idea where / how to update anything though.",
