    "body": "I just noticed that `spack clean --python-cache` deletes `.pyc` files in Spack-installed packages. If you install Python or Python-packages with Spack and then run `spack --debug clean --python-cache`, you can reproduce this.\r\n\r\nWe should probably ignore the `opt/` directory when traversing the filesystem. I don't think it will hurt anything, but it does slow down the Python installation temporarily and cause `spack clean` to take longer than it should.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `help` message for `--all` needs to be updated with the `-p` flag.\r\n\r\nP.S. Can we finally delete https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/bin/spack#L59,L81? These files haven't existed for years, and now we have a simple solution to clean them if users run into trouble.\r\n\r\n@healther ",
