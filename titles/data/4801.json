Is there also a good way to keep the log file, if there was no problem with the installation ?\r\n\r\nI tohugh about the \"dirty\" option in the config.yaml file, but this is not exactly what I am looking for, because it also does not cleanup the environment. I would like to just keep the logfile of the installation.",
