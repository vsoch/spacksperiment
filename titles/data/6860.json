    "body": "Background is provided in #6858. Essentially, this issue is that the command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack -d install parmetis%gcc` cflags=\"-O3 -march=native\" cxxflags=\"-O3 -march=native\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in compile commands of the form:\r\n\r\n`gcc -O3 -march=native <include directives> -O2 -g -o file.o -c file.c`\r\n\r\nThat is, the requested optimization level is ignored because CMake's initial compiler flags for gcc are _appended_ to the compile line.  To avoid this behavior, the initial `CMAKE_C_FLAGS` need to be disabled (set to an empty string).\r\n\r\nWhile I can do this locally for _parmetis_, it might make more sense to implement a general fix for spack's `CMakePackage` class, possibly by modifying the `flag_handler` functions (but I'm not sure how to implement this change).",
