Without the variant, libunwind\r\nwill look for liblzma in /usr/lib.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing flake will complain that the url line is too long.\r\nBut that line was already there, I didn't add it.\r\n\r\nSo, there are two options:\r\n1. ignore flake's complaint.\r\n2. split \"http:....tar.gz\" onto two lines.\r\n",
