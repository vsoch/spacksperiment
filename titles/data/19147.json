When I update Spack to a newer commit, all `spack install` commands try to reinstall all of my already installed packages. When I explicitly tell it to use a particular hash for the dependency, it is completely ignored and still rebuilds everything.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/spack/spack\r\n$ git checkout 075c3e0d9247e9c1716ac44e7052366ac59ff110~1\r\n$ spack install python\r\n$ git checkout 075c3e0d9247e9c1716ac44e7052366ac59ff110\r\n$ spack spec -I python\r\n$ spack spec -I /hashofpython\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-1279-eabfdba08f\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-catalina-ivybridge\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n@scottwittenburg I believe this bug was introduced in #18359, can you take a look?\r\n",
