GitHub and SourceForge) can provide tarballs for any branch or tag.  You just have to supply the right URL.  My experience using \"spack create\" in such a case was very good.  I just had to fill in the \"version(...)\" tag (but not the hashcode) manually.  With that, I got the following package.py:\n\n```\nfrom spack import *\n\nclass Blitz(Package):\n    \"\"\"N-dimensional arrays for C++\"\"\"\n    homepage = \"http://github.com/blitzpp/blitz\"\n\n# This version doesn't have the configure script generated yet.\n    url      = \"https://github.com/blitzpp/blitz/tarball/1.0.0\"\n\n    version('1.0.0', '9f040b9827fe22228a892603671a77af')\n\n    # FIXME: Add dependencies if this package requires them.\n    # depends_on(\"foo\")\n\n    def install(self, spec, prefix):\n        # FIXME: Modify the configure line to suit your build system here.\n        # FIXME: Spack couldn't guess one, so here are some options:\n        configure('--prefix=%s' % prefix)\n        # cmake('.', *std_cmake_args)\n\n        # FIXME: Add logic to build and install here\n        make()\n        make(\"install\")\n```\n\nSuggestion: add this note to the manual.\n",
