    "body": "I received a bug report from an internal user that `--with-parmetis=0` was set in petsc builds that depended on parmetis.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this was that conditional libraries were keyed on `+libname in spec`, despite the fact that there was no `parmetis` variant (parmetis is turned on by `+metis+mpi`).\r\n\r\nThis PR sets conditional libraries in petsc by whether the library is in the direct dependencies, rather than whether a variant is present. It also removes a check to prevent `+parmetis~mpi`, since there is no `parmetis` variant and the parmetis dependency is already conditional on `+mpi`.",
