    "body": "The dependencies on `libpciaccess` and `libxml2` come from the embedded `hwloc`, which, before MPICH 3.3, was used only for Hydra. Additionally, it is possible to use `hwloc`'s custom implementation of XML parsing instead of `libxml2`, which might be useful. For example, `libxml2.la` contains `-pthread` flag, which might not be recognized by Fortran compiler, e.g. NAG.",
