UFL and Fiat have a few released versions, but FFCX, DolfinX and the python interface to DolfinxX don't yet have a release version so are tagged to their master branches on GitHub. \r\n\r\nThis follows a different strategy to the current fenics package, which contains all of the components in a single spack package. It looks from #10240 that there might be some value in splitting that package into different components, some of which would be shared with the packages introduced here. \r\n\r\ncc. @garth-wells",
