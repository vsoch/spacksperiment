    "body": "<!-- Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\nExample: \"I ran `spack find` to list all the installed packages and ...\" -->\r\n\r\nI'm on the Theta supercomputer. I have a spack.yaml file describing an environment I want to install. When I create the environment, activate it, then type `spack install`, spack hangs indefinitely on this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> No binary for argobots-1.0-fmw2ekbof2tuxbqb6b2a3tdynnrp3pvi found: installing from source\r\n```\r\n\r\n(The argobots package here is for the example; it blocks just as well when the environment contains anoother packages)\r\n\r\nAfter experimenting with many variants of my spack.yaml file, I found that spack will hang if and only if the `target` field is provided. For example the following minimal spack.yaml will make spack hang:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack:\r\n  specs:\r\n  - argobots%gcc@9.3.0\r\n  packages:\r\n    all:\r\n      target:\r\n      - mic_knl\r\n  view: true\r\n```\r\n... but removing the two lines about the `target` makes it work fine.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of full reproducibility, here is a more complete spack.yaml file that also includes the compiler, so no yaml file is required in ~/.spack:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack:\r\n  specs:\r\n  - argobots%gcc@9.3.0\r\n  compilers:\r\n  - compiler:\r\n      paths:\r\n        cc: cc\r\n        cxx: CC\r\n        f77: ftn\r\n        fc: ftn\r\n      operating_system: cnl7\r\n      target: any\r\n      modules:\r\n      - PrgEnv-gnu\r\n      - gcc/9.3.0\r\n      environment: {}\r\n      extra_rpaths: []\r\n      flags: {}\r\n      spec: gcc@9.3.0\r\n  packages:\r\n    all:\r\n      providers:\r\n        mpi: [ mpich ]\r\n      compiler:\r\n      - gcc@9.3.0\r\n      target:\r\n      - mic_knl\r\n      version: []\r\n      buildable: true\r\n```\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nCopy the above spack.yaml on Theta.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack env create myenv spack.yaml\r\n$ spack env activate myenv\r\n$ spack install\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output. If there was no error message and no output but the result is incorrect, describe how it does not match what you expect. -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --debug --stacktrace install\r\n```\r\nThe above shows the following debug message from spack many times before blocking:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngpfs/mira-home/mdorier/spack/lib/spack/spack/compilers/__init__.py:446 ==> [2021-01-13-11:46:50.769068] Multiple definitions of compiler gcc@9.3.0for architecture cray-cnl7-mic_knl:\r\n [gcc(cc\r\n     CC\r\n     ftn\r\n     ftn\r\n     ['PrgEnv-gnu', 'gcc/9.3.0']\r\n     cnl7), gcc(cc\r\n     CC\r\n     ftn\r\n     ftn\r\n     ['PrgEnv-gnu', 'gcc/9.3.0']\r\n     cnl7)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI initially thought that spack was finding both the compiler definition in my ~/.spack/compilers.yaml file and in the spack.yaml file, but (1) the problem still persists if I remove gcc@9.3.0 from my compilers.yaml file, and (2) the problem still persists if I remove the compiler definition from the spack.yaml file.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0 (tested with develop as well)\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.10\r\n* **Platform:** cray-sles15-haswell\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
