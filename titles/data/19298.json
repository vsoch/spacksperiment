Is there any recommended way to make the build system depend on the version?\r\n\r\nI can think of two methods:\r\n1. Convert the package to use a custom build system and specify a different set of build steps depending on the version.\r\n2. Do something wacky with metaclasses to choose the base class dynamically depending on the version.\r\n\r\nIs there a middle road?",
