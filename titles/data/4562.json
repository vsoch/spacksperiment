OTOH, adding such a variant, which does nothing to affect how the package is installed, is probably totally meaningless to Spack.\r\n\r\nWhat is the right answer here? Avoid adding stuff to packages that have nothing to do with installing said pacakges (e.g. outcome of `make install` is no different either way)? Or, this is ok and/or encouraged?",
