    "body": "In some cases the FindHDF5.cmake returned a wrong value for the HDF5 library names and path. For example it returns `hdf5-shared` as library name without a search path or checking if this is really an existing shared library.\r\n\r\nBy setting `HDF5_NO_FIND_PACKAGE_CONFIG_FILE=True/ON` to the cmake options, the FindHDF5 module does not \r\n rely on a properly installed `hdf5-config.cmake` and thus searches for the library and its paths. This results in a usable return value and fenics works afterwards.",
