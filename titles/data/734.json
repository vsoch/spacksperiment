    "body": "I'm not sure if this is the right thing, but it solves my problems (for now) on Ubuntu 12.04 (which has a system-installed binutils 2.22).   The problem is that the Ubuntu-supplied ld crashes when linking the packages here.  A newer binutils fixes the problem.  See more detailed description below:\n\nTrying to build some packages (py-numpy, py-cython) causes /usr/bin/ld to crash with an error message asking you to report the bug to GNU.  This is binutils 2.22.  Everyone says, use a newer binutils.\n\nI tried doing this by saying `spack load binutils` before `spack install py-numpy`.  That had no effect.\n\nI got things working by adding `depends('binutils')` to the py-numpy and py-cython packages.  BUT.. I don't think this is really a good solution, because:\n1. Is this only a GCC problem?  Would I need to use the different binutils if I installed Intel compilers on my Ubuntu?\n2. binutils would seem to be part of the compiler, not something we should have to add as a depends_on() to every package.\n3. Once we've added depends_on('binutils') everywhere, most users will want to set binutils to no-build in packages.py\n4. It should really be a build-time dependency anyway (this will soon be available with upcoming PR merge).\n",
