    "body": "I'd like to see support for GCS Buckets to serve as Spack mirrors.\r\n### Rationale\r\nWhen building packages on Google Cloud, it is beneficial to have commonly built package binaries, such as compilers, hosted on a GCS bucket to help reduce installation time on new GCE instances.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI've drafted some changes at https://github.com/FluidNumerics/spack that would be necessary to support GCS mirrors. This work is based on the AzureHPC approach ( https://github.com/Azure/azurehpc/tree/master/apps/spack ) but is being adapted for usage with GCS.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nStarting from Spack version : `0.16.2-3078-cb009d0eab`\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ x ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [ x ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n",
