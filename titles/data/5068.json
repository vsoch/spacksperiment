The idea is to remove the build of `hypre ^mpich` (which was taking a long time to build, causing Travis timeouts) and substitute it with builds of more packages, chosen according to:\r\n\r\n- their build system\r\n- their build time\r\n\r\nCurrently we cover all build-systems apart from `QMakePackage` and `SconsPackage`. `cmake` and `r` are installed via `apt-get` and configured as externals. More details about the coverage deltas in the red crosses or green ticks below.",
