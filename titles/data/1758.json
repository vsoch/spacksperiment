I was reluctant to set a Package-level extension field.\n\nCommit message:\n\nThis closes #1757 which provides an example of a url scheme where the\nversion appears after the extension. Instead of extending the parsing\nlogic to handle this case, this commit allows the user to specify\ntheir extension type. This helps Spack choose the appropriate\ndecompressor and mirror archive filename.\n",
