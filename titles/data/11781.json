    "body": "Provide more explicit build logfile names\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nIssue #11749 pointed to the ease of opening shared log files with the `.txt` extension but the Spack team has since indicated there are multiple output filenames and circumstances to consider.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n \r\nUse `spack-build-<type>.txt` for log and env filenames, where `<type>` is `out` and `env` respectively, both during the build and in the installation directory.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nGreg (becker33) expressed concern about distinguishing between `.out` and `.env` files and suggested using:  `spack-build-out.txt`, `spack-build-env.txt`, `build-out.txt` and `build-env.txt`.\r\n\r\n~~Peter (scheibelp) pointed out that there should be different names if the installation failed or succeeded (i.e., `build-out.txt` for successful builds and `build-err.txt` for unsuccessful ones).~~\r\n\r\nUpdate 2019 June 26:\r\nTodd (tgamblin) wants the same names used in the build and install directories.  \r\n\r\nPeter (scheibelp) no longer wants the build log to be renamed on failure.  (The latter change was causing error log capture problems with `test_install_output_on_build_error` as described in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/11806#discussion_r297871667 for details.)",
