This PR updates the package to use a newly available public URL, as well as add the most recent 2.1.2 version. \r\n\r\nI wasn't sure how to best handle a dependency on the `shmem.h` header as there is no separate shmem/openshmem Spack package. Current package here attempts to source the header from the MPI installation, which is what the existing package did. ",
