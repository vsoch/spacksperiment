As it happens every unit test does this but I can imagine someone writing one and not setting return_output (default is false).\n\nSome nose plugins assign stdout to a stream object that does not have a .fileno attribute. This is required by subprocess.Popen (in executable.call). executable.call uses a pipe if return_output is true.\n\nPossible fix: detect whether stdout has a .fileno attribute and always use a pipe if so. \n",
