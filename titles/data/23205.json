    "body": "I'd like `spack find -L` to include the date-time stamp the package was installed, and a new flag `--latest` added to `spack find` and `spack location`  to show the last install of package that matches the provided spec.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nI have found that I often get multiple versions of the same package installed due to packages being updated, or trying to fix bugs as a developer.  In this case I'm wary of just doing a brute force pruning of the old packages by querying with `spack find --end-date`.   Also during the development cycle I can get multiple instances of the same package installed on the same day or very close to one another.  It would be nice to be able to just know from `spack find` when things were installed so I can pick and prune old packages, and to be able to find/select the latest version of a package without having to iterate on the `--end-date` because I can't remember when the last time I installed something.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nStated at the top of the feature request\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n```\r\nspack --version\r\n0.16.1-1672-821769c\r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
