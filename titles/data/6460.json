    "body": "This PR would add a check that every file in ```lib/spack``` and every ```package.py``` starts with the same license. The idea came when @junghans fixed the licenses in #6323 and similar which were generated by an older spack (see also #6345 )\r\nCurrently there are a lot of packages that have different licenses, I'm not sure whether this is intentional or just a side effect of the development history. The only references to \"license\" that I could find on readthedocs was to compiler licenses and not spack's own. So I really don't know what the target state should be. If this is completely unwanted feel free to close the PR.\r\n\r\nCurrent state:\r\n\r\n- [x] changed all licenses in ```lib/spack```\r\n- [ ] yet to change the ```package.py```\r\n\r\ncc: @tgamblin ",
