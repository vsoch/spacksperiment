    "body": "Compiler caching was using the `id()` function to refer to configuration dictionary objects. If these objects are garbage-collected, this can produce incorrect results (false positive cache hits). This replaces `id()` with an object that keeps a reference to the config dictionary so that it is not garbage-collected.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple considerations to account for:\r\n\r\n* The cache was originally introduced in https://github.com/spack/spack/commit/55f85f23079b7229204e89e29d568ac969931449 to minimize parsing of the yaml dictionaries, so while removing the cache altogether is safest, it would reintroduce performance issues that was meant to address\r\n* Using an alternate id to represent the object, like `(spec, os, target)` is appealing but makes it difficult to discover when a user's configuration file (or the combination of their files over multiple scopes) contains duplicate entries (there should only be one configuration entry across all scopes with a given `(spec, os, target)`).\r\n\r\n",
