I'm tired of facepalming....  This commit touches up the prose so that it actually includes a command that one can use to install the things.\r\n\r\nWhile I was there I touched up the prose about activating the new Python packages; activating a python package doesn't add anything to your PYTHONPATH, it links things into a directory that's *already* on your PYTHONPATH.  Note that this all presupposes that you're using that same python....\r\n\r\nWhat's the issue label for nitpicky-changes?",
