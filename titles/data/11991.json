    "body": "Fixes #11980 \r\n\r\nThis is the simplest possible fix to the issue I raised in #11980. Currently, if you have an external package like `jdk` which happens to be extendable, and you install an extension for that package, it becomes impossible to install that package or its extensions if you don't have write access to that directory. For example, on macOS, JDK is installed to the system `/Library` directory. It looks like Spack is trying to create a file to keep track of which extensions are activated, but crashes because that is not possible.\r\n\r\nTested on Python 2 and 3.",
