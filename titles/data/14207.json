Unfortunately on one of our clusters `fetch` freezes and after a very long time produces\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Error: [Errno 5] Input/output error\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan't figure it out. I thought it might be a permission or disk space problem, but I tried cloning into a few different locations and the effect is the same. This must be related to something in my environment or in the setup of this login host.\r\n\r\nI am attaching my [enviornment](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/3977644/env.txt).\r\n\r\nThere's a GPFS cluster in there, but I think on login host it is mounted via NFS.\r\n\r\nPlease advise.",
