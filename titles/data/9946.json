It should run better due to using recent dyninst 10.0.\r\n\r\nProbably neither will build on Cray due to spack's confusion of\r\nfront-end and back-end compilers as in issue #9613.  I don't even know\r\nif there is a recipe that would build toolkit on Cray without some\r\ntweaks inside spack.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd prefer to update this now, get it into an all-spack build,\r\nand then work on what's needed for Cray and Blue Gene.\r\n\r\nping @pramodskumbhar who wrote the previous recipe.  Maybe you'd like\r\nto try it out, let me know if it works for your use case.\r\n\r\nping @scheibelp for review\r\n\r\n",
