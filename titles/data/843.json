    "body": "This PR adds a trivial implementation of building the dependencies of a given package in parallel, using\n`spack install --parallel <target>`\n\nIt spawns each a thread per dependency. As the CPU time is spent outside Python this should be sufficient for a significant speedup. Concerning thread-safety I currently rely on\n- the GIL for all Python code\n- the separation of environments via os.fork for the actual build processes\n- an explicit handling to avoid building the same package multiple times\n\nAs I have no idea which implicit assumptions I break (how does `extends` behave?), I marked this feature as _experimental_ in the help message. Will be a long way to completion I suppose.\n",
