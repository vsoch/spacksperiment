    "body": "The Unified Model is an atmospheric model developed by the UK Met Office in partnership with researchers and weather services around the world. Outputs from the model are usually stored in a custom binary format (although netcdf can also be used in some applications). This package provides a library and a python interface to encode and decode fields from the binary files.\r\n\r\nThe package is required by py-scitools-iris, which is coming soon in a separate PR.",
