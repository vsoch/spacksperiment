See https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/5104 for the nitty-gritty details.\r\n\r\nThe reason no one has noticed it until now is that we lock down our version of Sphinx to 1.7.0 for the documentation tests.\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix would be to replace `sphinx.apidoc.main` with `sphinx.ext.apidoc.main`. This solution was not chosen because `sphinx.ext.apidoc` did not exist before 1.7.0. This solution _should_ work for all versions of Sphinx, although testing with older versions would be greatly appreciated.",
