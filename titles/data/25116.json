    "body": "`spack style` previously used a Travis CI variable to figure out what the base branch of a PR was, and this was apparently also set on `develop`.  We switched to `GITHUB_BASE_REF` to support GitHub Actions, but it looks like this is set to `\"\"` in pushes to develop, so `spack style` breaks there.\r\n\r\nThis PR does two things:\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove `GITHUB_BASE_REF` knowledge from `spack style` entirely\r\n- [x] Handle `GITHUB_BASE_REF` in style scripts instead, and explicitly\r\n      pass the base ref if it is present, but don't otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis makes `spack style` *not* dependent on the environment and fixes handling of the base branch in the right place.",
