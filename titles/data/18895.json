    "body": "Here, I was trying to work around an issue in the tests where my local git config was causing failures.\r\n\r\nAfter taking a closer look and doing some googling, I realize that running git as part of a script (or in this case, as part of Spack) and *not* taking the extra measures needed to ensure that it is isolated from user- and system-provided git configs is inherently broken.  This is a separate issue that I intend to follow up on with a more-comprehensive PR.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, I will revert the change.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @opadron in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/17792#r493707206_",
