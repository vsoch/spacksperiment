Try manually downloading from here to see that:\r\nhttps://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Libelf\r\n\r\nThe solution in these cases is usually to find the same tarball from a well-known Linux distro source, and change the package.py file to use it.  As long as the checksum is the same, it's all OK.\r\n\r\nMaybe try slackware:\r\nhttp://ftp.slackware.com/pub/gsb/gsb64-2.30_slackware64-13.1/source/l/libelf/\r\n\r\n\r\n",
