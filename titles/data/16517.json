For example, python may be built with a proprietary compiler for performance, but belong on the `Core` directory.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, lmod config can include a `core_specs` list. Any package that satisfies a spec in that list is placed in `Core`, regardless of its compiler or dependencies.\r\n\r\n@mplegendre @nicholas-sly This is the feature we discussed earlier, although the implementation is I believe much simpler than the prototype I showed Matt previously.",
