    "body": "- Adds new versions of magics\r\n- Since magics@4.3, proj@6 is required (see also [source](https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/wiki/proj.h-adoption-status) and https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/11763). \r\n- In addition it seems that @4.1.0:4.3.1' requires netcdf (legacy interface) even though it shouldn't - even if `-DENABLE_NETCDF=OFF` is set, building magics still requires netcdf. This also fixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/14182 (or rather bypasses the problem).",
