The reason is that Glibc 2.28 made _IO_IN_BACKUP private.\r\n\r\nThe bug is already reported at https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1573342 and a workaround patch by Vitezslav Crhonek can be found in the package hosted at https://fedora.pkgs.org/rawhide/fedora-x86_64/m4-1.4.18-9.fc29.x86_64.rpm.html.\r\n\r\nI added this patch to the m4 package and currently only enabled it for the 1.4.18 version of m4.",
