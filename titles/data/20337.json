    "body": "With version 5.0, LIKWID got a profiling interface for Nvidia GPUs (based on CUPTI).\r\nWith 5.1, the interface was extended to work with the new CUpti Profiling API.\r\nThis PR adds a variant switch to activate that feature.\r\n\r\nSingle issue left: How to find the subfolder below `spec['cuda'].prefix` which includes `cupti.h`? It's not in `spec['cuda'].prefix.include`. Same for `libcupti.so` which is not in `spec['cuda'].prefix.lib`. The hardcoded paths `spec['cuda'].prefix + \"extras/CUPTI/{include,lib64}\"` probably work but might break in the future. Is there a spack-way to do it or should the standard library be used for this?",
