    "body": "The cmake buildsystem of magma (2.5.x) explicitly adds `-Wno-unused-function` to `CXXFLAGS` and `CFLAGS`. The `-W*` are compiler specific, but the compiler is not checked. For me this broke installing it using NVHP/PGI.\r\n\r\nAs compiler warnings are usually not interesting for spack users (who could also add them if needed), this PR adds a patch to the magma which removes the offending lines.",
