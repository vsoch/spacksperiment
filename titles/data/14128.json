    "body": "Installing motif does not work, see the corresponding issue #14127 . The problem is that the upstream package does not expect header files from the `xbitmaps` package to appear in a different prefix than the other X11 libraries. I made a patch to correct for this, and force an autoreconf in the package.py script.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I have found that autoreconf complains about missing AUTHORS and NEWS files in the source distribution. The same patch also adds dummy files to satisfy autoreconf.",
