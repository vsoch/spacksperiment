    "body": "We would want to be able to run monitoring, and generate all metadata that can be updated to a monitor server later. This is the goal of this PR, and the work will come in two phases. The first here is to allow saving of a local result with spack monitor, and the second will add a spack monitor command so the user can do spack monitor upload. You would run like:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ spack install --monitor --monitor-save-local zlib\r\n```\r\nAnd then upload later (probably with a little more granularity but the gist is:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ spack monitor upload <some identifier>\r\n```\r\nI'm wondering what the best way is to organize these builds in .spack/reports/monitor. Right now I have based on timestamp, and we will only be able to tell if a result has already been uploaded by providing the server with the same information we use to generate a build id (e.g., look up a build) so arguably the user could just provide some match string of dates to upload, and we would check them all. E.g.,\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ spack monitor upload 2021-05-19\r\n```\r\nTo upload all results from today.
