Replacing my `mvapich` entries with `mvapich2` resolved my problem. \r\n\r\nI am new to external packages, so I am not quite sure what the behavior should be for a package name that spack doesn't provide. But it was quite surprising that `intel-mpi` came into the mix due to my typos. \r\n\r\nIs this the expected behavior? If no matches, it just picks the first provider alphabetically ? (That seems to be one possible explanation for `intel-mpi` vs other providers)\r\n",
