I didn't find this described in the manual, and various packages seem to be using various methods:\n- `tty.error(...)`\n- `raise RunTimeError(...)`\n- `raise InstallError(...)`\n  I think none of these actually work the way they are intended, although they all do abort the install -- because the respective identifiers are not defined.\n",
