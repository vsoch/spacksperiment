My goal is to change the current functionality as little as possible, just replacing `setup_(dependent_)?_environment` and fixing bugs I see along the way.\r\n\r\nNow that no packages use `setup_(dependent_)?_environment`, should we delete those methods and the respective tests, or keep them around as deprecated functions for a little while?",
