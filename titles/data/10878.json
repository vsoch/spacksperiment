So, we'll see how the\r\njudge rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, hpcviewer depends on java, but the tcl module that spack\r\ncreated for hpcviewer doesn't depend on java.  I was expecting that\r\n`module load hpcviewer` would also load jdk as a dependency, but it\r\ndidn't.\r\n\r\nThe module file sets `PATH` and `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and prints a help\r\nstring.  Nothing else, no mention of java.\r\n\r\nDid I miss something, or do tcl modules just not support dependencies?\r\n",
