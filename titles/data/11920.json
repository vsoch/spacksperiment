    "body": "According to the documentation at https://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/:\r\n\r\n> Iris implements a data model based on the CF conventions giving you a powerful, format-agnostic interface for working with your data. It excels when working with multi-dimensional Earth Science data, where tabular representations become unwieldy and inefficient.\r\n\r\nIris can read, write and visualise gridded data in netcdf, grib and UM formats. It is especially useful when working with the Unified Model, which is developed by the UK Met Office and numerous collaborators for weather and climate forecasts.",
