    "body": "I'm on Ubuntu still trying to install Ipopt with clang. I found out that when building with clang, Spack's compilation of Ipopt finishes without error, but no shared library is produced, just a static one. When build with gcc, a shared library is obtained, as expected.\r\n\r\nI went into spack's Ipopt stage and had a look at Ipopts configure output. Indeed, I found the following lines there\r\n```\r\nchecking whether the /home/home.calcaholic/ad08uzis/spack/lib/spack/env/clang/clang++ linker (link -m elf_x86_64) supports shared libraries... yes\r\n[...]\r\nchecking if libtool supports shared libraries... no\r\nchecking whether to build shared libraries... no\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen calling the configure script again but without spack's build environment and instead giving the compilers directly by adding `CXX=clang++ CC=clang F77=gfortran`, then the output reads\r\n```\r\nchecking whether the clang++ linker (/usr/bin/ld -m elf_x86_64) supports shared libraries... yes\r\n[...]\r\nchecking if libtool supports shared libraries... yes\r\nchecking whether to build shared libraries... yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen then compiling Ipopt, the shared library is build.",
