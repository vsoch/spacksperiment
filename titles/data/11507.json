On trinity, it goes on to source /etc/bash.bashrc because it doesn't care about the --norc command line option. When Trinity upgrades, this will break there, too.\r\n\r\nHere is the conditional that causes this to break from /etc/profile: if test -z \"$_SOURCED_FOR_SSH\" -a \"$norc\" != true ; then\r\n\r\nIt used to be just if test -z \"$_SOURCED_FOR_SSH\" ; then",
