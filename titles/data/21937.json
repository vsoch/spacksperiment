This is fine, but the exit code of this process is 0 even though the package I want to build (A) did not build. I would also expect an error message at the end of this informing me that the package I requested could not be built.\r\n\r\n@tldahlgren I believe this may be related to the parallel build stuff you added a while back, maybe you can take a look. I've seen reports of this bug on Slack, but I don't think anyone has opened an issue on GitHub yet.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-1537-29201814cc\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.7\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-catalina-ivybridge\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
