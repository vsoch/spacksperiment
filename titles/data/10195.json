    "body": "In #10148, I added an import test for `libxml2`'s Python library. I also changed `extends('python')` to `extends('python+shared')`, as the unit tests crashed when `python~shared` was used.\r\n\r\nI just tried reinstalling the package with the tests and found out that the tests no longer pass. It turns out that when `python` checks whether or not to set `PYTHONPATH`, it doesn't think `libxml2` extends `python`. Apparently `extends` can't handle variants.\r\n\r\nI see two possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. `extends` does not support variants. This should be enforced by preventing variants in the `extends` directive.\r\n2. `extends` does support variants. The check in `python` package that tries to tell whether or not a package extends it should work properly.",
