    "body": "This is a hack to deal with the legacy cuda families for `paraview` as noted in #22970.  I haven't tested this on a cuda build, but it at least allows clingo to concretize.\r\n\r\nI imagine we will need to add in some of the logic like vtk-m to get this to work.  Ideally it would be nice to just drop this cuda family stuff in `paraview` and move to the gencode like the vast majority of other packages. Looking at `vtk-m` it seems that they use the gencode for defining the variant and then use a map to fulfill their own cmake args.  It would be nice if `paraview` would pursue the same model (assuming it's the same requirement), but I'm not sure how much of a burden that would be on the users. \r\n\r\nTo support both the quickest thing I could think of was to append the list of values. I guess we could also do an inverse of the  map `vtk-m` has and then change the spec value for the `cuda_arch` variant.",
