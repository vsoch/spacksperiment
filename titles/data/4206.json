Illumina's build instructions say that I should `cd` into that directory and run configure.  I'm planning to let/help `CMakePackage` handle that final step.\r\n\r\nThe install method of the turbomole package [does a little dance in the install method](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/turbomole/package.py#L82) untar-ing something and then doing everything inside a `with working_dir(...`.\r\n\r\nAre there any other existing examples of packages for which the source is doubly archived?\r\n\r\nWould it be cleaner to extend/override `fetch` or ....\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
