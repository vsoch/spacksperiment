    "body": "On my system I have the gcc compiler located in both `/usr/bin/gcc` and `/bin/gcc`. \r\n\r\n`which gcc` points to `/usr/bin/gcc`, and indeed `/usr/bin` occurs before `/bin` in my `$PATH`.\r\n\r\nSpack however adds `/bin/gcc` as a gcc compiler when I run `spack compiler find`.\r\n\r\nI guess historically there was some reason to return the list of compilers in a reversed order in `arguments_to_detect_version_fn`, but the current logic in `find_compilers` keeps a flat list and filters that, passes it to `make_compiler_list` which does a stable sort, and then takes the first working compiler from the list. So that means the order should not be reversed.\r\n\r\nThis problem came up in https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/17932",
