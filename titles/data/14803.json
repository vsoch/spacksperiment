    "body": "*Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe first time a user installs spack and sets it up, the module path will not get added to the modules environment.  Therefore if you install a spack package that defines a module file and immediately try to load it, modules will not find it.\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\n 1. LLNL LC Pascal\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n",
