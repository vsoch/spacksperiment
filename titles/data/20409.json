    "body": "variant moab+cgm is not building anymore\r\n\r\nmoab still uses *.la libtool library files to resolve dependencies \r\n\r\nSo `spack spec moab+cgm` works as expected, but \r\n`spack install moab+cgm` does not, with compile errors related to missing *.la files in cgm installation. Looking at the cgm build, I see that the *la files are built, but they are not installed anymore in cgm installation folder, in spack; \r\n\r\nmoab build:\r\n[spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5697791/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\nIn the corresponding spack-build-out file for cgm, I do see that the libcgm.la file is \"created\", and installed, but I assume something in spack removes them after that\r\n\r\nlibtool: install: /usr/bin/install -c .libs/libcgm.lai /media/iulian/ExtraDrive1/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu18.04-skylake/gcc-7.5.0/cgm-16.0-ygl2gpl46w5k5wzhpsqoye4trts5nbom/lib/libcgm.la\r\n\r\ncgm build:\r\n[spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5697818/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\nSo can we still use *la files or not anymore ? we think the long term solution is to use *.pc files (pkg-config), that seems to be supported by spack (and encouraged? ) \r\n\r\nOr is it possible for a quick fix to still install *.la files ? \r\n\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
