The problem is that the version checker in code.l does only check subminor version but not minor version. Therefore the version checker thinks that flex@2.6.4 ist older than flex@2.5.33 for example. code.l could be patched but I did not think that it would it is worth the effort since it only affects the oldest doxygen version :-)",
