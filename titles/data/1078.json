    "body": "Previously, py-pillow linked to the system libraries instead of the Spack-built libraries. This PR fixes that.\n\nNote that this solution is actually [recommended by the developers](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#external-libraries):\n\n> If the prerequisites are installed in the standard library locations for your machine (e.g. `/usr` or `/usr/local`), no additional configuration should be required. If they are installed in a non-standard location, you may need to configure setuptools to use those locations by editing `setup.py` or `setup.cfg`, or by adding environment variables on the command line:\n> \n> `$ CFLAGS=\"-I/usr/pkg/include\" pip install pillow`\n\nI actually tried using environment variables but to no avail. Hacking `setup.py` is also the [solution that Homebrew uses](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-python/blob/master/pillow.rb).\n\n@citibeth: You were the last person to edit py-pillow. Can you confirm that this solution works for you?\n\nNote that I'm still having trouble getting it to link to Tcl/Tk. Any solutions are welcome.\n",
