Its design allows inclusion of another geometry model by implementing a single sub-module instead of writing bilateral converters for all already supported models.\r\n\r\nLink: https://github.com/vmc-project/vgm\r\n\r\n(Part of an effort to contribute spack packages from the Electron-Ion Collider repository to the broader NP and HEP community.)",
