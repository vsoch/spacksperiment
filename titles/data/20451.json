This appears to be a recurring problem that was identified in\r\nthe mesa gitlab issues here:\r\nhttps://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/2843\r\n\r\nUsing `_llvm_method = 'auto'` is broken. This patch replaces that with\r\n`_llvm_method = 'config-tool'`, which is a hack, but makes it possible\r\nto build.\r\n\r\nI have commented on the closed issue (2843), referencing the original\r\nauthor of the bug, and one of the mesa developers, so perhaps they will\r\nfix the problem.\r\n",
