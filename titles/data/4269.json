I mean, would `+metis` and `+lapack` appear in spec given the `depends_on` lines above? I was thinking not.\r\n\r\nFinally, I started wondering why MFEM included logic to check this error and I believe its because suite-sparse depends on lapack and metis...in which case, why does MFEM include any logic for this? Why doesn't it just depend on suite-sparse package to get it  right? \r\n\r\nSo, I guess my question is, isn't this MFEM logic wrong and shouldn't it be removed?",
