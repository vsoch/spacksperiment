    "body": "@adamjstewart: this simplifies the output reduction args in `Executable.__call__`, which we talked about in #350.  See what you think.\n- simplify output, error, and input redirection\n- `return_output=True` is now `output=str`\n- `return_output=True` will still work for the time being but is\n  deprecated.\n- previously you could say `return_output=True` and `output=<stream>`,\n  which wouldn't actually write to the stream.  Now you actually can't\n  specify erroneous cases since there is only one parameter with\n  mutually exclusive options..\n",
