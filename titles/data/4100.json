    "body": "It took me a few passes outside of spack, but this impacts intel-parallel-studio at the very least. \r\n\r\nIf neither the TMPDIR environment variable nor the installer script flag `-t, --tmp-dir [DIRECTORY]       set custom temporary folder` is set, the Intel installer tries to write files into /tmp which may be several gigabytes in size. If the /tmp directory is too small, you get a message from the installed stating that you're out of disk space without letting you know that it was /tmp and not your target install directory. \r\n\r\nI'd issue a pull request for my local hack, but I'm not sure what the right answer is for defining TMPDIR for installer usage in spack.
