It downloaded several hundred .{pop,jar} files and I despaired of\n   figuring out some way of mirroring and checksumming them; and\n2. It exploded complaining about too many unacceptable license files,\n   which seems odd in its own source tree.\n\nPerhaps someone with more Java fu that I admit to can figure it out.\nIn the meantime, this is useful.\n",
