    "body": "This is an attempt to make the logic related to the `legacylaunchers` a bit more straightforward:\r\n1. Currently, two different specs \u2014 `openmpi+legacylaunchers` and `openmpi~legacylaunchers` \u2014 produce identical installations. As far as I know, we usually try to avoid that.\r\n2. The message of the stub script is meant for the application users (i.e. the users of the software stack). They don't have to know anything about Spack. Therefore, I think that the message should be more generic. Also, symlinking `mpirun` and friends to a single file makes it easier to modify the message manually after the installation if needed.\r\n3. Inexperienced Spack users might find it very confusing that they don't get what they usually get when installing the package manually. I think `+legacylaunchers` should be the default but produce a warning when `schedulers=slurm`. More experienced users can simply add `~legacylaunchers` to their `packages.yaml` (the most experienced ones already have it :).",
