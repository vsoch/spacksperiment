Forgot to update the tab completion script with the new command\r\n2. Docs didn't format well: http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/binary_caches.html\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tab completion and updates the docs to fit better with the rest of our documentation.\r\n\r\n@gartung Can you see if these changes look good to you?",
