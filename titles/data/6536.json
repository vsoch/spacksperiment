In this case replacing the old layout root with the new layout root does not work. The rpaths with still refer to the non-default relative prefixes.\r\n\r\nAny replacement or rpaths happens in a workdir before  moving the files to the install prefix. This prevents having a broken install prefix left over since I did not clean up on exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/pull/6512\r\nand \r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/pull/6344",
