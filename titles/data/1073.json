Adds a platform for Cray XK7 which changes `Platform.detect` for Cray systems to use an environment variable as opposed to the existence of the path `/opt/cray/craype` which is not platform-unique.\n2. Allows `Target`s to specify multiple environment modules so that Cray compiler wrapper options (linking style, target architecture, etc) can be modified when using the Cray compiler wrapper to target service nodes vs compute nodes.\n",
