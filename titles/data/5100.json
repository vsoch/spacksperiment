    "body": "I am writing some tools that use spack to test/probe packages a slew of different ways (with various compilers, with various optimizations, with various warning flags, shared/static, compiling C code with c++ compiler, use clang static analyzer (or some other static analyzer), etc. \r\n\r\nSome of the aforementioned activites are just variations on invokation of `spack install <whatever>`. Others are more involved. Lets focus on the simple ones for now.\r\n\r\nSuppose I wanna probe a package's behavior with -Wall and then, separately, -Werror. From -Wall build, I wann count and collect the warnings. From -Werror, I wanna just test if the compile succeeded or not.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to effectively script this kind of thing up? I am thinking I would like to code everything in python and then maybe just use spack as a `module` that my python script loads and uses. However, I am not sure of that nor aware of any examples of using spack that way. Alternatively, and somewhat more conceptually simple for me, I can write shell script(s) that do this kind of thing.\r\n\r\nI am just wondering if there is a preferred/recommended way of doing this kind of thing?",
