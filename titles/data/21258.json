    "body": "Sometimes we need to patch a file that is a dependency for some other automatically generated file that comes in a release tarball. As a result, `make` tries to regenerate the dependent file using additional tools (e.g. `help2man`), which would not be needed otherwise. In some cases, it's preferable to avoid that (e.g. see #21255). A way to do that is to save the modification timestamps before patching and restoring them afterwards. This PR introduces a context wrapper that does that.\r\n\r\nIn the aforementioned PR #21255, the following code:\r\n```python\r\nmtime = os.path.getmtime(patched_file)\r\nfilter_file('^#! @PERL@ -w', '#! /usr/bin/env perl', patched_file)\r\nos.utime(patched_file, (os.path.getatime(patched_file), mtime))\r\n```\r\ncould be replaced with:\r\n```python\r\nwith keep_modification_time(patched_file):\r\n    filter_file('^#! @PERL@ -w', '#! /usr/bin/env perl', patched_file)\r\n```\r\n",
