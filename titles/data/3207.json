    "body": "Fixes #3204.\r\n\r\nOr at least, that's what I would like to say. I tried pretty hard to follow https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/numpyscipy-with-intel-mkl but I'm still seeing the same error message. I opened an issue with the numpy developers (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/8653). Hopefully they can get to the bottom of this.\r\n\r\nI figured I would open up this WIP PR in the meantime to show what I'm trying to do. It offers several advantages over the way we were previously doing things.\r\n\r\nIf I'm going to rework this stuff, I want to do it right this time. Before this PR is merged, I plan on running the full numpy and scipy test suite for the following combinations:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Intel 17 - Intel MKL - Python 2 - CentOS 6\r\n- [ ] Intel 17 - Intel MKL - Python 3 - CentOS 6\r\n- [ ] GCC 6 - OpenBLAS - CentOS 6\r\n- [ ] GCC 6 - ATLAS - CentOS 6\r\n- [ ] Clang 8 - OpenBLAS - macOS 10.12\r\n- [ ] Clang 8 - Netlib BLAS/LAPACK - macOS 10.12\r\n\r\nAny other combinations anyone would like to see?\r\n\r\nIntel also provides a numpy benchmark. I may try that out with a few combinations and report back the performance. I'm curious as to how much of an improvement I get with Intel MKL.",
