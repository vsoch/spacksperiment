This commit\ndoes the following:\n- Unset variables that were incorrect from the auto guess prefix\n  inspections.\n- Add a RemovePath `environment_modifications_formats` for dotkit.\n- Set the module environment variables appropriate for the different\n  variants.\n- Change the component logic so that the '+all' variant works. It was\n  getting split by letter and leaving COMPONENTS empty.\n- Added a variant checking function.\n- Added NONRPM_DB_DIR to the silent.cfg so that the product database\n  goes to the installation directory.\n- With the product database in prefix the code to remove the product\n  database file from the home directory is no longer needed and was\n  removed.\n- Reformat the 'tools' variant description.\n\nThere are probably more variables needed for the '+tools' for the\n'professional' product version but I do not have access to that.\n",
