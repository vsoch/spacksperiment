    "body": "This PR addresses an issue with DDD where, when it queries the initial settings from GDB, it does not handle properly the setting for `extended-prompt` and a bogus value is injected into one's own `~/.ddd/init` file.  This bug is instigated when the user attempts to `Edit -> GDB Settings`.  Then, upon subsequent invocation of DDD, it hangs attempting to initialize GDB with a bogus setting.  See the commentary at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2914003/ddd-hangs-on-start.  The advanced GDB user may still make use of the `extended-prompt` in their own `~/.gdbinit` file.",
