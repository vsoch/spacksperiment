(although the variant resolution mechanism is still broken). But all of the following commands work for me now:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec r\r\n$ spack spec r+X\r\n$ spack spec r~X\r\n```\r\n@hartzell @samfux84 can you test this?\r\n\r\n@tgamblin can you confirm that my diagnosis of the problem is accurate?",
