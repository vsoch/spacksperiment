    "body": "Sourcing `setup-env.sh` upon startup takes ~10 sec for me on my laptop, where modules are not installed. With the following change, this now take ~1 sec. I believe the logic was inverted, as there's no reason to set `MODULEPATH` if modules isn't installed.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed the `setup-env.fish` file. The `setup-env.csh` file doesn't seem to have support for this. Should we add it? We should also add tests for this.",
