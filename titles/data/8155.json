    "body": "@alalazo @scheibelp \r\n\r\nI'm using an external MPI, which was hand-installed, with a hand-built module.  I need to load the module to properly build my tree.  Thus, I need to use `--dirty`.  It would be cleaner if I could specify this module somewhere; for example, in `config.yaml`:\r\n```\r\nconfig:\r\n  dirty: false\r\n  modules: [other/comp/gcc-5.3-sp3 module load other/mpi/openmpi/1.10.1-gcc-5.3-sp3]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any way to do this????  I didn't find one, although I know there are a number of places where Spack will load modules for you (in `compilers.yaml`, for example).\r\n\r\nPS: I have to load the `gcc` module because the `openmpi` module has been hand-coded to require it.\r\n",
