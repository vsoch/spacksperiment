What Spack does is to replace the \"$(CC.$(OS))'\" string with the selected MPI's mpicc specified in `spec['mpi'].mpicc`,  then run make. The embarrassing thing is that I tested it under `%gcc ^onmpi` only when I submit simul package, leaving `%intel ^intel-parallel-studio` untested. \r\n\r\nAccording to Spack's doc http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html?highlight=mpic , `spec['mpi'].mpicc` should get the MPICC compiler for `intel-parallel-studio`. Please correct me if I use `spec['mpi']` in the wrong way.\r\n\r\nLink to mdtest package https://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/mdtest/package.py . ",
