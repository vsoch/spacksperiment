Or\n> more specificly... if C --> B --> A, then what is the dependency\n> relationship between C and A?  When there was just one kind of dependency,\n> this was easy.  But now that there are many kinds, we need a well-defined\n> function that tells us the details of the C --> A relationship, based on\n> the C --> B and B --> A relationships.\n\n@tgamblin suggested it needs a response.\n",
