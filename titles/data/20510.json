The CI script includes the following in a function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack install $PKGNAME\r\nRET=$?\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script then reports the value of RET in a log file.\r\n\r\nFor the past week or so, I've been hit by [this issue](https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/20454), effectively making all my packages fail to build because automake-1.16.3 could not be built.
