    "body": "Adds ZeroMQ 4.2.2, which has a slightly modified build environment and fails when build from the [official tarball](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/releases/download/v4.2.2/zeromq-4.2.2.tar.gz) (so we checkout [the git tag](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2621)). The `autoreconf` step depends on #4736.\r\n- [x] update: I used the wrong tarball link, we can also use the `.tar.gz` instead and sha it\r\n- but that release does not build with [some versions of CMake anyway](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2621#issuecomment-314782300)\r\n\r\nAdds the C++ Headers for ZeroMQ aka `cppzmq` that first build with `libzmq` (ZeroMQ) [v4.2.2](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/pull/2295).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in order to install the C++ headers of ZeroMQ, the `libzmq` (ZeroMQ package) needs to build [as `CMakePackage` instead of `AutotoolsPackage`](https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq/pull/128). Otherwise, the [CMake module to find it is not created and installed](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq/issues/2621#issuecomment-315297320).\r\n\r\nNow, if we generally change the build to use CMake for ZeroMQ it seems to fail on already submitted versions... How do we proceed? Can we specify to build all further versions in `4.2.0:` with CMake and the older with autotools? Or shall I add a temporary `FindZeroMQ.cmake` in the patch step from [some issue I found on the internet](https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq/issues/127)? :)\r\n\r\n## Update\r\n\r\n- [x] I might just patch in https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq/issues/132 and we can stay with autotools",
