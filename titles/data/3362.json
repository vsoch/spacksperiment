In the meantime this is a WIP that is the first thing I was going to try.\r\n\r\nThis omits setting the toolset/compiler during the bootstrap phase when the frontend target does not match the boost spec target. This also rearranges the PATH within the boost installation process to put spack compiler wrappers last, so if any compilers are part of the default search paths boost will use those to create the build system.",
