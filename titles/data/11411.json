    "body": "- Codecov cannot handle as many coverage reports as we are generating\r\n- As a result, our PR coverage pages have been broken for a while, and it's hard to tell people where to enhance their testing in PR reviews.\r\n- Scale back to only running coverage for 3.7 and 2.7\r\n- Make coverage depend on `COVERAGE=true` being in the environment, so we can control it from `.travis.yml`\r\n- This is *probably* better.  We run the build tests for good measure, but we do not need to evaluate them for coverage.  The coverage reports are about unit tests.",
