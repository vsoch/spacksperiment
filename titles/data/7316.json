Here is how I solved it temporarily for my own purposes, but how do we handle this in general.  Someone must have wanted version .163 to be the default, but that doesn't work for all builds.   So, asking for advice on how to fix for all to be happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    version('0.170', '03599aee98c9b726c7a732a2dd0245d5', preferred=True)\r\n    version('0.168', '52adfa40758d0d39e5d5c57689bf38d6')\r\n    #version('0.163', '77ce87f259987d2e54e4d87b86cbee41', preferred=True)\r\n\r\n",
