    "body": "Some minor changes were required to build the ncl package fully on RHEL6 and RHEL7. The Configure script reported an error when cairo was built without X support. The linker reported missing symbols when `-lm` was not included in the argument list. The installation succeeded despite these errors, but the installed package was only partially complete, and the `ncl` executable and other important components were excluded. The changes in this request avoid the errors and result in a complete ncl installation.",
