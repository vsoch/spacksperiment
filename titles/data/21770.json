(This is done automatically for USE_THREAD=1 , and should not\r\n   64 # be necessary when USE_OPENMP=1)\r\n   65 # USE_LOCKING = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to my tests, with `spack install --test root blaspp`, this exactly addresses the issues in BlasPP tests.\r\n\r\nIt also seems to be a good option to set by default for OpenBLAS and users that do not need this safety net can always disable it.\r\n\r\ncc @G-Ragghianti @mgates3\r\n\r\nFollow-up to #20956",
