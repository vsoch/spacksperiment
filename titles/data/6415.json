    "body": "@tgamblin  and I were not happy with my initial implementation of flag handlers. This new implementation provides a more intuitive syntax that can be more easily extended by individual packages.\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of compiler flags will not change: By default they are injected through the compiler wrappers.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a flag_handler method to the package which controls how the compiler flags are passed to the build and can be used to add package-specific flags. Three builtin flag handlers are defined on PackageBase. `inject_flags` is the default, `env_flags` puts the flags into environment variables, and `command_line_flags` puts the flags on the command line for build systems that support doing so. Packages can also override the flag_handler method (called independently on each set of flags) by hand.\r\n\r\nFor further detail, see the accompanying changes to the documentation.\r\n\r\n@reviewers: Let me know if you think the `flags_to_cl_args` method should be documented. I don't expect it to be user facing, but if you think there's use in putting it in the documentation I can add it. It would allow users to implement command line flag handling on a per-package basis, but I don't currently see a use case for that.",
