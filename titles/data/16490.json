    "body": "I regularly use the `spack concretize` command to get a sense of what `spack install` will do in environment before I actually run it. This is especially important when using upstreams, as you really want to make sure you're using upstream packages. I felt the command needed some improvement.\r\n\r\nThis merge request:\r\n - Adds documentation for what the 'package status' glyphs mean. \r\n - Changes the glyphs to be a bit more obvious\r\n   - All are in square brackets `[-]` and bold.\r\n   - Installed is now `[\u2714]`\r\n   - Missing is now `[?]`\r\n   - Upstream is now blue.\r\n - Updated the corresponding glyph that's written when installing to a checkmark.\r\n - Install status now also checks that the install location exists.\r\n - Added a `-d/--dry-run` option to `spack concretize`, to see the tree without\r\n   actually updating the spack.lock file.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-05-06 12-05-25](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51765748/81212382-121b5600-8f92-11ea-9dcb-885f393cadf7.png)",
