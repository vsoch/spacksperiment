This makes it impossible to override the default flags provided by autotools (for instance, `binutils cflags='-O2'` will still build with `-O2 -g`). Instead, use injection for our workaround flags and pass other flags to the build system.\r\n\r\n@haampie Would this work for you as an alternative to #18123?",
