    "body": "A `depends_on()` with no variants specified is concretized as requiring a version built with _exactly default variants_ because of the `concretize_variants` behavior.  I would contend that this is unnecessary, and actually unfortunate.  This is the root cause of #267 for example, and requires rebuilds to get a _less_ complete version when variants are used to enable extra features.  For example, testing the new llvm rework by adding a dependent rust compiler package, depending on `llvm` required a rebuild of llvm because the installed version had `+gold` when the default was `-gold`.\n\nWhy are variants this draconian, rather than accepting any package that matches all _specified_ variants?\n",
