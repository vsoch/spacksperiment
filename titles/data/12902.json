    "body": "This works around #12852.\r\n\r\nThe perl-readonly package builds from the Build script generated\r\nby the configure step. The Build script has the shebang with the spack\r\nbuilt perl. This script needs to run before the shebang has been been\r\nmodified for overly long shebangs and will thus fail to run if it\r\nhappens to be too long. Work around this by switching the shebang of the\r\nBuild script to `#!/usr/bin/env perl`.",
