    "body": "This depends on (and is based on top of) #7774.  It's really just one commit (the last one).\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered why Spack is behaving a certain way or using a particular external package?  Do you wonder what [configuration scope](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html) a particular setting came from?  Now you can find out! `spack config blame <config file>`  will print out the YAML for a Spack configuration section, annotated with the file and line where each setting came from.  So, now you can track down exactly why your configuration works a certain way.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1275\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-05-09 at 10 25 26 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/299842/39853662-61ca68d2-53d8-11e8-8058-c0287a00eac3.png\">\r\n\r\nIn this picture, you can the full, merged `config.yaml` on the right.  On the left, you can see that some settings come from hard-coded builtings (`_builtin`), some come from the default Spack `config.yaml`, some come from `~/.spack/config.yaml`, and some come from the command line.\r\n\r\nThis works for any config file, so you can do the same thing with `spack config blame packages` or `spack config blame compilers`, etc.",
