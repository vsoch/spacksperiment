    "body": "This issue seems related to #5800 .\r\n\r\nI'm on Mac OS. I installed clang 5.0.0 with spack and tried to install a package that depends on OpenMP with clang 5, such as kripke ( spack install kripke -mpi %clang@5.0.0 ). CMake fails to find the OpenMP C flag and exits with an error. The log is attached.\r\n\r\nI bumped into this when trying to compile a package.py that I made and got this error, then tried a standard package to confirm. This issue seems like would affect any package using the CMake build system that uses the find_package(OpenMP) functionality to set up the compiler flags, such as:\r\n\r\nfind_package(OpenMP)\r\nif(OPENMP_FOUND)\r\n    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS ${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS})\r\nendif()\r\n\r\n[spack-build.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/1454353/spack-build.txt)\r\n\r\nThe package compiles outside of spack by loading the spack modules it depends on and building normally. Is this related to the compile wrappers?",
