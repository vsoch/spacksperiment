Consolidated code to read spec.yaml and database index.yaml into\n   one method (`read_yaml_dep_specs()`) in spec.py.\n4. Code understands old hash format, tuple format, and dicts for dep\n   specs, for backward compatibility.\n5. Spec YAML now uses a dict with keys to represent dep specs (this is\n   more future-proof).\n6. Dep specs no longer contain !!py-tuple entries in YAML (only lists\n   properly YAML-ize)\n7. bump database version.\n",
