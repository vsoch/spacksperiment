Package python requires version 2.7:2.8, but spec asked for 3.6.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for this, that `node-js` depends on python2 to build:\r\n```\r\ndepends_on('python@2.7:2.8', type='build')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs python2 is only required as build depency for node-js is should be possible to build node-js with python2 and use jupyter with python3. \r\nIs it possible to pass this to spack?",
