Note, that the modifications in schema/compilers.py are currently decorative as the whole file is because it's missing the following lines (see #6652):~~\r\n```diff\r\n         'compilers': {\r\n             'type': 'array',\r\n             'items': {\r\n+                'type': 'object',\r\n+                'additionalProperties': False,\r\n+                'properties': {\r\n                 'compiler': {\r\n                     'type': 'object',\r\n                     'additionalProperties': False,\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [x] tests\r\n- [x] documentation\r\n\r\n**UPD:**\r\n- [x] fixed the yaml schema for `compilers.yaml`: now it really checks the format",
