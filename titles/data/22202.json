    "body": "This is a continuation of #21904 . I could not reopen because I did a force push.\r\n\r\n* Align spack packages to oneapi standalone packages: https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/oneapi-standalone-components.html\r\n* Use the vars.sh to setup the environment\r\n* eliminate a lot of complicated code that centralized generating the URL's. I found it is easier to implement and understand if you cut and paste the versions and URLs from https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/oneapi-standalone-components.html into the package.\r\n* add some documentation\r\n\r\nI attempted to add macos support for #22178, but ran into some problems--the installer requires sudo and I don't know how to manage that. I removed all the mac code, but saved it in this branch: https://github.com/rscohn2/spack/tree/dev/mac.\r\n\r\n@scheibelp: ready for final review. It might be easier to look at the full files then the diffs",
