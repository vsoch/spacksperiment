This happens due to the fact that many packages can't be configured twice, they simply fail to build the second time. It's extremely annoying when I run \"spack install\", go home, and then discover that it failed a few minutes after I left my office.\r\n\r\nI think that \"--restage\" should be the default behavior, and there should be an option \"--no-restage\" or \"--keep-stage\" or something to reuse the old stage.",
