The [Spack package definition](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/udunits/package.py#L13) uses a URL that points to www.gfd-dennou.org. This site seems to be completely unrelated to UCAR, and most of its information pages are only in Japanese.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1151\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-03-17 at 4 35 09 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7389890/111534880-d9661480-873e-11eb-8b88-82375af32987.png\">\r\n\r\nAlso, the package versions in the package.py file do not correspond to files available on either UCAR's [download page](https://artifacts.unidata.ucar.edu/service/rest/repository/browse/downloads-udunits/) or on gfd-dennou.org. Spack is getting these from its AWS mirrors, and these old versions fail to build on recent macOS releases.\r\n",
