    "body": "PyTorch has trouble finding the MKL libraries when they are not in default system install locations. On macOS, simply setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to the `<prefix>/mkl` directory is sufficient, but on Linux, the libraries are tucked away inside `<prefix>/mkl/intel64/lib`. This PR sets the appropriate CMake environment variables to allow PyTorch to find MKL. I put the changes in the `IntelPackage` base class so that other packages can benefit from this too.\r\n\r\nTested with PyTorch 1.3.1 and master on macOS 10.15.2 and Amazon Linux 2 with Intel MKL 2019.4.233 and 2019.5.281.\r\n\r\nFixes #14232 \r\nFixes https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/24334\r\n\r\n@coreyjadams can you test this out?",
