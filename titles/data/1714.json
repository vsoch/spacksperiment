    "body": "With `setup_environment`, `JAVA_HOME` is appropriately set on `spack load jdk`, which is great.\n\nHowever, if I do `spack load thing_that_depends_on_jdk`, it is not set.\n\nSeems like the behavior should be to set the runtime environment for all dependencies when loading a package. Right now I have to explicitly `spack load jdk` before loading any modules that depend on jdk, since they look for `JAVA_HOME` at runtime.\n",
