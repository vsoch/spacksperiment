In our local trunk there are patches tackling that but I currently don't know exactly what they are doing (even though I apparently authored them...)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if its worth fixing now as #7152 is taking a larger view onto that and also actually fixing the conflicts rather than just ignore any conflicts and pray for the best (I believe that is what we are doing). \r\n\r\nThoughts?
