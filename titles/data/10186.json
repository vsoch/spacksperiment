The #10050 tried to solve this in `colify.py`, but I think the issue is that we weren't properly decoding text at the edges in the first place. I tracked this down to the pipe read in `spack.util.executable`, and just made *that* treat everything as proper unicode.\r\n\r\nThis also adds a test to verify that we're able to round-trip unicode through an `Executable` object.\r\n\r\n- [x] When returning string output, use text_type and decode utf-8 in Python 2 instead of using `str`\r\n- [x] This properly handles unicode, whereas before we would pass bad strings to colify in `spack blame` when reading git output\r\n- [x] add a test that round-trips some unicode through an Executable object",
