It should not be merged yet as I am still testing the new versions.\r\n\r\nSince the tarball URL has changed as part of the 1.0 release process, support for old 0.x versions of pocl now adds a bit of complexity. Should I drop these old releases or do we need to keep them around for compatibility?",
