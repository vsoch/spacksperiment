    "body": "This PR builds on https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/4168.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to have a libfabric in spack use other libraries from spack (e.g. verbs and psm2), and in turn have openmpi use libfabric instead of building directly against verbs or psm2. \r\n\r\nThe +spackfabrics variant of libfabrics is a bit clunky feeling, but allows people to do nothing & continue using system libraries. If that's not needed, I'm happy just making opa-psm2 and rdma-core default dependencies of libfabrics instead, and letting them be overridden as external packages instead as needed.",
