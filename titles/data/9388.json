    "body": "Consider stripping installed binaries or providing at least an option to do it.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThe size of a lot of installed packages is huge, mainly due to binaries.\r\nFor example, GCC 8.1 take almost 1.1 GB (with around 1 GB of binary files).\r\nStripping binaries drastically reduce this package size up to 200 MB (5x less)!\r\nThe same benefits can also be observed on binutils and many other packages.\r\nAs the home user space on HPC machines are often limited, users might not be able to install all the packages they need.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nintroducing an automatic stripping of installed binaries after the install phase can help to significantly reduce the disk space footprint.\r\nThis can easily be done by calling strip on each binary file produced during the install phase that lies in directories such as bin, lib and lib64.\r\nAn alternative could be to tune compilation flags.",
