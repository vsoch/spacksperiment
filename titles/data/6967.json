This adds support for wget to URLFetchStrategy and falls back to it if curl is not found.\r\n\r\nThis also removes support for the `curl_options` parameter and replaces it with a more generic `headers` parameter.\r\n\r\n(I have also replaced the curl arguments with their long versions to make the code easier to understand.)",
