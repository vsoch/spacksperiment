    "body": "This fixes a bug in the Tcl/Tk installation #8151.  Previously, the recipe for `tk` would erroneously pick up the system-installed `tcl.h` file.  This \"worked\" for newer systems that had TCL 8.6 installed.  The bug was unmasked building on SLES 11, which comes with an older version of TCL.\r\n\r\nLong story short, the `tcl` build references the original sources upon install, and the `tk` build requires the `tcl` sources.  TCL sources were installed following the example of #4102.  If the user installs with `spack install --source`, then the sources would be copied twice.  This should not be a serious problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n@junghans @davydden @tgamblin from #4083:\r\n> Do we need a global variant, which modifies the hash for no reason related to the artifact, or would it make sense to just make this an install option\r\n\r\nNote that this is a case in which the presence of the source is structural, not an install option.  If it were optional (it's not), then a `+source` variant would be warranted here.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** In addition, a `make install-headers` was added, as per advice for TCL 8.6\r\n\r\n#",
