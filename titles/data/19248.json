    "body": "Changes to support running pipelines on pull requests from forks.  At a high level, this change supports:\r\n\r\n- Running pipelines with no secrets whatsoever, or whatever secrets do happen to be available \r\n- A code path for PRs allowing pushing binaries to an alternate mirror.  This will improve developer experience in cases when the first push to a PR branch causes a rebuild to an expensive package, but subsequent pushes wouldn't cause subsequent rebuilds.\r\n- Makes use of #19209 so that only a single install pass is required to install packages (spack would previously have installed a binary cache even if it's `full_hash` was different than the locally computed one).  Allows us to do away with:\r\n  * Do a first pass install with `--only dependencies` and `--cache-only`\r\n  * Replace the re-written `spack.yaml` which was rendered useless by the first install\r\n  * Do a second pass install with `--only package` and `--no-cache`\r\n\r\nThe changes here are based on #19209 and require that to be merged first.",
