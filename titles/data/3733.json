The ISAAC library can be build with render/filter kernels for Nvidia GPUs via CUDA or with a more general backend via [Alpaka](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/alpaka) with support for  Nvidia GPUs (via CUDA) and multicore CPUs.\r\n\r\nSince alpaka is not yet part of spack, the second variant is still commented out.\r\n\r\n## Packages\r\n\r\n- `isaac`: header-only library with dependencies to other C++ libraries that is then used in simulations\r\n- `isaac-server`: stand-alone executable that connects N simulations with M clients in a `N simulations:1 server` and `1 server:M clients` fashion\r\n\r\n(ISAAC clients simply speak websockets/JSON and are usually [HTML/JS pages](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/isaac/tree/v1.2.0/client))\r\n\r\n## Downstream Usage\r\n\r\n[PIConGPU](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu/) uses ISAAC for in situ visualization.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- [Repo](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/isaac) (LGPLv3+)\r\n- [Documentation](http://computationalradiationphysics.github.io/isaac/)\r\n- [Talk at GTC2016](http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2016/video/S6294.html)",
