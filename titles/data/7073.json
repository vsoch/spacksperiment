    "body": "Packages with binutils dependencies (e.g., LLVM) will add binutils to the spack environment path during builds, which causes build systems to preferentially use spack's `ar` and `ld` over the system `ar` and `ld`. This namespace resolution is problematic because it results in warnings from the linker stating that the static libraries built are for the wrong architecture.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to follow Homebrew's convention of prepending 'g' to the GNU versions of any native BSD system utility. This PR also fixes the error I made in #7060.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that more packages need this sort of fix (e.g., `tar`, `sed`), but I haven't yet run into issues with those tools yet.",
