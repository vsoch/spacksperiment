    "body": "I tried to install several Qt versions on MacOS and all of them failed, because of different reasons. Most of the times, `qmake` is built, but then it's like if the configuration failed: It cannot find libpng, libjpeg, it even tries to include a SDL header (!!) and even `<linux/videodev2.h>`\r\n\r\nBTW, there's an early error because of the patch for overflow with Intel compilers: I'm using LLVM but anyway this patch is thrown anyway, and then it fails when patching 5.14 with the latest patch available (5.12). This was easy to overcome (just comment out the Intel patches, as I'm not using that compiler).\r\n\r\nThere was one version (I think it was 5.7.1) that was almost there: None of the weird errors mentioned above took place, but then there's a compilation error because of some datatypes not defined (I guess some incompatibility from that version to the system headers I have).\r\n\r\nI even tried the fork by [davydden](https://github.com/davydden/spack/tree/25d9f48454c48f8a4214f2cbc75abdc35c57310e/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/qt) because it seemed to be at a MacOS-fixed point in history, but it also failed with the configuration errors above.\r\n\r\nIs there any version that I didn't try and that it's known to work on MacOS?",
