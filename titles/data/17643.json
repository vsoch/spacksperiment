    "body": "Adds the Totalview package.  Requires the source be downloaded externally, as Totalview doesn't make their source publicly available for download.  A license is also required to use this product.  There are also a couple more architectures than those for which resources are currently defined, but not having those myself, I can't assert the proper filename format to specify here.\r\n\r\nAs explained in the package file, the installation procedure is a little unusual.  This package assumes that the documentation tarball is always available (and is thus the \"source\" tarball) and only downloads the real source tarball appropriate for the target architecture as a resource.  As such, the addition of new versions will require adding a new version entry with the hash of the documentation tarball along with the addition of appropriately constrained (`when='blah'`) resources for the architecture-specific source tarballs.",
