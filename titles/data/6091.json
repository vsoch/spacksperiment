    "body": "Is there a way to run a config test similar to autoconf's\r\nAC_COMPILE_IFELSE from inside a spack package.py?  That is, I want to\r\nwrite a short code snippet and ask if the given compiler successfully\r\ncompiles (or links) this piece of code.\r\n\r\nThis came up in the context of intel-tbb where the build failed\r\nbecause the code assumes that all non-PHI x86's have transactional\r\nmemory and I'm running on a machine that doesn't.  It's a simple test\r\nto write C code that generates an asm instruction and try to compile\r\nit.  How do I do that?\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the thematic spack way of handling this is with a\r\nvariant.  But I consider that unsatisfactory because it pushes all the\r\nwork to the end user.  The user has to know what all the tests are,\r\nrun them, and then write a long spec for every variant.\r\n\r\nA better solution is to have package.py run the test.\r\n\r\nAn even better solution is to get Intel to fix their config and make\r\nscripts to correctly test for this, but that's another story.\r\n\r\nOne possibility is to write an actual autoconf configure script, run\r\nall the tests and then write out a spec to feed into spack.  But I was\r\nlooking for a more integrated solution.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n--Mark\r\n\r\nP.S. I did search for configure tests, but I didn't find anything on\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n",
