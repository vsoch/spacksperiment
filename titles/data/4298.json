    "body": "I had a couple of failing tests on our Cray machines (Edison|Cori), these changes make sure that all tests pass. Unfortunately, I am not sure whether these changes are NERSC specific. If some other Cray users had failing tests, could you check to see if they work on your systems? Thanks!\r\n\r\nJust to summarize:  \r\n\r\narchitecture.py\r\n  - fixed detection of Cray platforms  \r\n\r\ncmd/flake8.py\r\n- Hard to get flake8 in your path unless it's provided for you already. And getting it in your path would involve starting a virtualenv. \r\n\r\nconftest.py  \r\n- This one might cause problems but it's the only way to use svn on our systems. If it ends up causing problems, then this will probably remain NERSC specific.\r\n",
