    "body": "Add tribool.patch to add explicit casts from tribool to bool in two\r\nplaces.  Boost, starting with version 1.69, turned on explicit\r\nconversions for tribool, which breaks the build for dyninst.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this PR is to allow dyninst 9.3.x and 10.0.0 to work\r\nwith the latest boost >= 1.69.\r\n\r\nAlso, probably within a week, I expect dyninst 10.1.0 to be released.\r\n10.1 will include the patch.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to wait for 10.1 to be tagged and released and fold that\r\ninto this PR.  It's a 1-line change to add version 10.1.0 and I could\r\nadd that line now.  (I know what the tag will be.)  We just have wait\r\nuntil the tag exists before merging the PR.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning in favor of waiting, but we could do two commits if the\r\nrelease is delayed.  Either way.\r\n\r\nping @hainest from dyninst",
