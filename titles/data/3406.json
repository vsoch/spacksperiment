    "body": "While building `flex`, I had `bison` fail because it could not execute `m4`. The reason was that I had uninstalled the `m4` package (via Spack) which `bison` installed as its build dependency. Then, `bison` failed since this `m4` executable did not exist any more.\r\n\r\nI think `m4` needs to be a run-time dependency of `bison` as well.",
