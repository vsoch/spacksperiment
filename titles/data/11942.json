This actually ended up catching a bug in the code output by `spack env deactivate --sh` -- it now works properly with `set -u`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add shell tests to ensure that `spack env activate`, `spack env deactivate`, and `despacktivate` continue to work.\r\n\r\n- [x] Also ensure that activate and deactivate both work with `set -u`",
