    "body": "Add the GALAHAD optimization library.  GALAHAD is a little unusual in that it requires a manual download, and it has a strange build system.  But it does useful optimizations, and these Spack packages do work.\r\n\r\nOther optimization packages include NLOpt.\r\n\r\nFor now, I no longer use GALAHAD in my work.  But I recommend this gets merged anyway, because the build works, and somebody else might want it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.galahad.rl.ac.uk/doc.html",
