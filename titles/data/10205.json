know where libc++ is.\r\n\r\n * gcc7.3.0 builds cmake correctly; clang-6 doesn't work either\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's anything else you want me to try.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing messing with `environment` or `extra_rpaths` in the compilers.yaml will fix this, but then `spack compiler find` should fill them in.",
