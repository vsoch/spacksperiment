    "body": "Closes #7646. @thilinarmtb can you test this and see if it works for you?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the latest version of `libxcb`, which finally has Python 3 support. I didn't uncomment the Python dependencies because I'm still running into concretization problems when I do, not sure why. We can uncomment them once #2548 is merged.\r\n\r\nAlso added more specific `xcb-proto` version requirements.\r\n\r\nAll builds passed their unit tests with Python 3.6.4 and Clang 9.0.0 on macOS 10.13.3.",
