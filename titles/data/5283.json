I could not build it due to unrelated build error with `libstdc++.so.6.: version CXXABI_1.3.8 not found (required by /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libicuuc.so.55)`, could be related to [this](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/faq.html#faq.how_to_set_paths) and most likely [that](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35392310/error-building-gcc-4-8-3-from-source-libstdc-so-6-version-cxxabi-1-3-8-not). [EasyBuild](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild/issues/158) has the same issue. Maybe we simply miss `depends_on('gettext')`\r\n- [ ] 4.7.4 -- first version without `c` language option, conflict is already declared in the package. Unfortunately can't build it with `languages=c++,fortran` due to another build error `cfns.gperf:32.1: error: unknown type name class`",
