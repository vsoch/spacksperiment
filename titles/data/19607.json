    "body": "Add an option to `spack mirror create` to enable downloading more recent versions of the source in the event of a hash mismatch.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWe maintain a mirror of all packages for our site.  We update this periodically (about hourly).  We hit an issue recently where the `libpng` package changed where the source changed and the hash for each version changed with it.  When a user tried to install that package with a recent version of Spack whereas the mirror still had the old versions of the package source.  This threw a hash mismatch error.  The way we can see to update this automatically would be to determine what packages have different hashes, create a separate mirror with those packages, and then move those into place in the production mirror.  Having an option on `spack mirror create` that checks this for us and downloads the latest version that matches the hash in the `package.py` files.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nImplement a `--update` option for `spack mirror create` that will check the hash of files currently in the mirror and replace them if the hash doesn't match.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n<!--*Add any other context about the feature request here.*-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [ ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
