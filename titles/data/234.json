    "body": "I was wondering if there are already some thought on exporting linking information for packages providing a virtual dependency.\n\nIn the case of blas/lapack the way to link with a given package could change. For now only `netlib` and `openblas` package are providing `blas`. Openblas already has a trick to have a libblas.a\n\nBut if at a point atlas also provides `blas` it is already not so easy to link with it. Especially if you consider the shared libraries that can be build as a sequential or threaded library `libsatlas.so` and `libtatlas.so`. This becomes even more complicated if you want to link with libraries like the mkl.\n\nFor package using cmake as a make system a way would be to set the environment variable `BLA_VENDOR`. But I guess that this would cover only few packages.\n\nFor all the others, a solution would perhaps be to have a way for packages to express in there spec different {c, fc, cxx}flags and ldflags that can be used to link with them.\nWith variation of this flags with a default that should always be there and then variation of them for example for threaded atlas or mkl.\n",
