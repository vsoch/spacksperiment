    "body": "Previously to use the pre-defined flag_handler methods, you needed to type `flag_handler = Package.env_flags` or the equivalent.\r\n\r\nNow you can type `flag_handler = env_flags`.\r\n\r\nAs a reminder, the default flag handler is `inject_flags`. It uses the spack compiler wrappers to inject the flags. The other two builtin flag handlers are `env_flags` and `build_system_flags`. The `env_flags` flag handler puts the flags into the canonical environment variables. The `build_system_flags` flag_handler is only available for `AutotoolsPackage` or `CMakePackage` packages and puts the flags onto either the `configure` or `cmake` line, respectively.",
