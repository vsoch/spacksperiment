    "body": "New functions `deprioritize_system_paths()` and `prune_duplicate_paths()` have been added to `util/environment.py` with tests, and functionality to use them from `EnvironmentModifications` has been added, along with tests. In addition, all functions in `util/environment.py` have tests in `test/util/environment.py` and one now-redundant test in `test/environment.py` has been removed in favor of an equivalent test in the more appropriate `test/util/environment.py`.\r\n\r\nThe new functions are particularly useful in recipes using `PATH`-like variables where entries in `packages.yaml` might cause issues by putting (_e.g._) `/usr/include` ahead of paths from specific spack-installed packages.\r\n\r\n`deprioritize_system_paths(name)` will move identified system paths to the end of the `name` `PATH`-like variable (preserving the original relative order of same), while `prune_duplicate_paths(name)` will remove the second and subsequent mentions of any given path.\r\n",
