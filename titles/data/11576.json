    "body": "Previously, the vtkm package was adding a \"../\" option to the\r\ncmake command line. I suppose this was supposed to be pointing\r\nto the source code, but did not. Rather, Spack correctly adds\r\nthe source directory as the first argument to cmake. However,\r\nbecause ../ was added, it used that as the source directory\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nSimply remove this argument to make CMake work correctly.",
