It is no longer the object output by `shutil.ignore_patterns`: you pass a function that accepts a path relative to the source and returns whether that path should be copied.\r\n* When a symlink target is absolute, `copy_tree` and `install_tree` now rewrite the source prefix to be the destination prefix \r\n* `copy_tree` tests no longer check permissions: `copy_tree` doesn't enforce anything about permissions so its tests don't check for that\r\n* `install_tree` tests no longer check for exact permission matching since it can add file permissions",
