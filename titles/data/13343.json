I know this because I get build errors saying that the clang@5.0.1 can't find headers like `<parallel/algorithm>` and `<ext/alloc_traits.h>` which are in the gcc@4.9.3 stall.\r\n\r\nIs there anyone who has gotten llvm/clang builds with Spack to successfully point to the g++ C++ header files?\r\n\r\n",
