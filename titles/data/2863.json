    "body": "From the [automake documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html):\r\n\r\n> A last and optional step is to run make installcheck. This command may run tests on the installed files. make check tests the files in the source tree, while make installcheck tests their installed copies. The tests run by the latter can be different from those run by the former. For instance, there are tests that cannot be run in the source tree. Conversely, some packages are set up so that make installcheck will run the very same tests as make check, only on different files (non-installed vs. installed). It can make a difference, for instance when the source tree\u2019s layout is different from that of the installation. Furthermore it may help to diagnose an incomplete installation.\r\n>\r\n> Presently most packages do not have any installcheck tests because the existence of installcheck is little known, and its usefulness is neglected.\r\n\r\nIt isn't very common, but it is a real phase.",
