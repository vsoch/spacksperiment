    "body": "I'm trying out Spack on Windows using the Ubuntu WSL, which contains Python 3.8. So far, everything works fine, but I noticed the following untracked directory:\r\n```\r\nlib/spack/external/jsonschema/__pycache__/\r\n```\r\nThere are `__pycache__` directories throughout Spack, but they are normally ignored because we ignore `*.pyc` files. In this case, the offending directory contains a `exceptions.cpython-38.pyc.140647793774000` file. I don't know if this is specific to Python 3.8, but https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore includes `__pycache__`, so we should too.\r\n\r\nHonestly, we should probably copy all of https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore into our `.gitignore`. Let me know if you want me to do that.",
