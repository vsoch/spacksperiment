    "body": "I have a very specific problem trying to install a package on Linux.\n\nI want to install magma from ICL http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/software/index.html\nbut it seems that the build is not done in the good directory.\nGenerally, when we untar a tarball, say magma-1.6.2.tar.gz, the resulting directory magma-1.6.2/ is at the same level, but in my case a folder named spack-expanded-archive/ is created and the build is done in it where the source code is actually in a lower stage in spack-expanded-archive/magma-1.6.2/.\nOf course there is no Makefile in spack-expanded-archive/ but it is in spack-expanded-archive/magma-1.6.2/.\n\nAs Todd has explained, the algorithm in Spack when untaring before building is the following:\n1. download the tarball.  Stage directory looks like this:\n   archive.tar.gz\n2. make a spack-expanded-archive directory\n   archive.tar.gz  \n   spack-expanded-archive/\n3.  expand the archive in the new directory\n   archive.tar.gz\n   spack-expanded-archive/\n   archive/\n4. If only ONE directory is created, move that to the top level like this, and remove the temp directory:\n   archive.tar.gz\n   archive/\n5. If there is more than one file created, or if the created file is not a directory, Spack just leaves the temp directory:\n   archive.tar.gz\n   spack-expanded-archive/\n   Makefile\n   src/\n   etc...\n\nIn my case, the result of \ntar xf http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projectsfiles/magma/downloads/magma-1.6.2.tar.gz\nis a hidden file ._magma-1.6.2\\* and the expected directory magma-1.6.2/\nso that we are not in step 4 of the algorithm anymore and Spack try to build in spack-expanded-archive/ where there is no Makefile file of course.\n\nMaybe hidden files should be ignored when the algorithm choose whether or not it faces a crappy tarball.\n",
