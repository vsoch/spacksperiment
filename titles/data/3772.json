    "body": "On a system where the native python is version 2.6, the serf package in spack fails to build. I found that adding a `depends_on('python')` to the serf package fixed the problem, because scons then uses the spack-built `python@2.7` at run-time, matching the version used during installation of scons.\r\n\r\nI am not sure why it is necessary to add an explicit dependency on python, when scons is installed as a python package. Shouldn't all python extension packages imply a run-time dependency on python? And similarly for extensions of perl, R, etc.?",
