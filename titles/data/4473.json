    "body": "Fixes #4472.\r\n\r\n@mpilosov Can you test this out? The problem was that one of the optional dependencies (sphinx) depended on whether or not the `+doc` variant was on, but there was no `+doc` variant! As far as I can tell, it looks like this variant was always missing. I'm not sure why it didn't raise an error message before. Possibly related to @alalazo's recent work on multi-valued variants. I agree the error message could be more helpful though. I don't know how to fix that one but @alalazo might.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at it I made a few unrelated changes. Converted `fenics` to `CMakePackage`. Also fixed a couple deptypes. I can't imagine that `eigen` is only a build dependency or `cmake` is a run-time dependency, but correct me if I'm wrong. Also separated the Python component installation into 2 phases. I think this makes much more logical sense now.",
