    "body": "Currently the autotools script copies the config.guess file to packages with an old autotools install.\r\nWhilst this resolves the issues with many packages some still depend upon the config.sub file.\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces a naive way of copying a corresponding config.sub file when copying a config.guess file - whilst assuming the locations are the same.\r\n\r\nThis fixes some package build issues on arm, such as argtable, where the updated config.guess is insufficient.\r\n\r\nI have not included any additional error checking - if necessary and/or if you would rather this in its own routine, then please feel free to edit / reject.",
