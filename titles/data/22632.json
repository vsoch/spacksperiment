    "body": "Hello\r\n\r\nI am on a paraview plugin project and I need to debug it and find memory leaks. I was wondering if there is any debug variant or options which set all debug flags. I am not aware about all debug flag paraview provides, but for example, I have seen the \"VTK_DEBUG_LEAKS\" flag (which is by default to OFF), but I cannot use it without modify the spack recipe. Is there an installation option with spack to have all the debug features ?\r\n\r\n@chuckatkins , @danlipsa , @vicentebolea, have you an idea ?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nElo\u00efse ",
