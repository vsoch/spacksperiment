In short, you simply couldn't install Charliecloud with said variant.\r\n\r\nTo reduce Charliecloud dependencies and simplify packaging we replaced `skopeo` and `umoci` functionality with a native python3 script, [ch-tug](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud/pull/616).\r\n\r\nWe'd like to remove the builder variant completely. Charliecloud 0.13 (unsupported) was the last release depending on skopeo and umoci, thus this PR removes it completely.\r\n\r\n",
