    "body": "I want to build without Fortran compiler. Currently, OpenBLAS is the hold-up because it requires a Fortran compiler. A comment there says \"As of 06/2016 there is no mechanism to specify that packages which depends on Blas/Lapack need C or/and Fortran symbols. For now require both.\"\r\n\r\nCould we introduce such a mechanism? For example, there could be virtual packages `lapack-c` and `lapack-fortran` which would not require the other language. The current `lapack` virtual package would imply it needs both C and Fortran.",
