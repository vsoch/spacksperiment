    "body": "Spack currently parses the results of `module show` in order to locate some packages. This can be fragile (see #9083 and #9100).\r\n\r\nIt was suggested at https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/9083#issuecomment-416314241 that Spack could load the module and inspect the path. This has the potential to avoid a whole bunch of parsing issues. However, it also requires some consideration: for example if Spack took this approach, it should load the module in a subprocess or make sure to unload it.",
