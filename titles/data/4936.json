    "body": "SCons as a build system is terribly non-uniform. It provides a common library for package developers to write installation scripts, but the installation scripts themselves can vary drastically. Some developers add subcommands like:\r\n```\r\n$ scons clean\r\n$ scons build\r\n$ scons test\r\n$ scons install\r\n```\r\nOthers have no subcommands. Some have configuration options that can be specified through variables on the command line. Others don't. By default, SCons builds all packages in a separate execution environment, and doesn't pass any environment variables from the user environment. Even changes to `PATH` are not propagated unless the package developer does so. This means that Spack's compiler wrappers aren't compatible with SCons in most cases. See #4927.",
