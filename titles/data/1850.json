    "body": "   I started an install and it failed with lots of text to the screeen and a pointer to a file for specifically what failed but no indication of a simple way to report back to the Spack developers all relevent information. For example what all my compiler and configuration options are etc. Perhaps on failure Spack could generate a list of exactly what files I should include in the Issue report? Maybe also generate files that we should submitt with a .txt extension since github issues don't like attachments with a .out extenstion. So you don't have to keep coming back to users and asking for more information? Perhaps you have this and I couldn't find it? \n\nAnyways, the specific failure I got was \n###### ################################################################## 100.0%\n\n==> Staging archive: /Users/barrysmith/Src/spack/var/spack/stage/openblas-0.2.19-ys4mqarh3gjib36khldodtkpcl4dicix/v0.2.19.tar.gz\n==> Created stage in /Users/barrysmith/Src/spack/var/spack/stage/openblas-0.2.19-ys4mqarh3gjib36khldodtkpcl4dicix\n==> Applied patch make.patch\n==> Building openblas\n==> Error: Command exited with status 1:\n'/Users/barrysmith/Src/spack/lib/spack/env/cc' '-o' 'check' 'test_cblas_dgemm.o' '-L/Users/barrysmith/Src/spack/opt/spack/darwin-elcapitan-x86_64/clang-8.0.0-apple/openblas-0.2.19-ys4mqarh3gjib36khldodtkpcl4dicix/lib' '-llapack' '-lblas' '-lpthread'\n\nSee build log for details:\n  /private/var/folders/c1/ldz_dt8n2r3dtwv_chp5pfr40000gn/T/barrysmith/spack-stage/spack-stage-bLlt6r/OpenBLAS-0.2.19/spack-build.out\n\nI've attached the spack-build.out file \n[spack-build.out.txt](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/491900/spack-build.out.txt)\n\nNote that the directory /Users/barrysmith/Src/spack/opt/spack/darwin-elcapitan-x86_64/clang-8.0.0-apple/openblas-0.2.19-ys4mqarh3gjib36khldodtkpcl4dicix does not exist I don't know if this is because you delete it automatically on failure or if it never existed?\n\nAlso attaching ~/.spack/compilers.yaml and ~/.spack/packages.yaml (again note the nuisance factor of having to rename them to attach to github issues.
