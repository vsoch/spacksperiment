This PR simply renames the method.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on #20298 to test whether renaming is sufficient to actually execute the test.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Making the information available to the test requires more changes to Spack to retain build dependencies for this purposes.  The LLNL Spack team has begun discussing options.",
