    "body": "The package's Makefile was overriding PREFIX= passed on the command-line. I added logic to remove that line from the Makefile. As a result, the Makefile recipes to build the package, which include -install_name flags, now specify the correct path to the installed lib.\r\n\r\nAlso, with gcc-6.1 on my osx system, it would NOT build without -flax-vector-conversions flag. So, I added logic to add that cflag for that compiler or later.",
