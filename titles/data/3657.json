    "body": "When `spack list` (and maybe also other Spack commands) is run from a Spack installation that is not a Git repository, an annoying `fatal: Not a git repository` is printed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack list\r\nfatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git\r\n==> 1114 packages.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis occurs both with the latest Spack v0.10.0 release and well as current `develop`.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that the check done in `git_case_consistency_check` is incorrect. It checks whether the `git` command is available, rather than checking whether Spack is being run from a Git repository.\r\n\r\nThere is a `get_git` command available in `spack.cmd.pkg` that does the correct check, but it's currently failing hard when Spack is not being run from a Git repository.\r\nSo, I've relaxed it to optionally just return `None` rather than the path to the `git` command (or whatever it is that `which` returns, doesn't matter).",
