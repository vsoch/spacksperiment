The mechanism that permits this is an implicit conversion of the variant passed as argument to the type of the variant asking to execute a constrain, satisfies, etc. operation.\r\n\r\nThere are two statements in the tests that are commented right now, as they lead to failures. They are under a FIXME comment, and are commented because it may be possible that the failures are legit (but need to discuss this with @tgamblin).",
