It requires a package from https://test.pypi.org/simple/\r\n\r\nThe former can be fixed by setting the `SPACK_TEST_SOLVER` environment variable to `clingo`.\r\n\r\nThe latter though requires clingo-cffi to be pushed to a more stable package index (since `https://test.pypi.org/simple/` is meant as a scratch version of PyPI that can be wiped at any time).\r\n\r\nFor the time being we can resort to using a container for this test and switch back to the usual Github Action VMs when `clingo-cffi` will be uploaded to PyPI.",
