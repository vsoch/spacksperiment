I'm hoping we can clarify that in this thread.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I believe we need a list of the different kinds of things that might happen when A->B.  Here is a probably incomplete list:\r\n 1. B's module loaded by A's module?\r\n 2. B added to A's build environment?\r\n 3. B added to A's RPATH?\r\n 4. B built as a prerequisite for A?\r\n 5. ...any other effects that MIGHT happen?\r\n\r\nNext, we need a specification of how a deptype affects the above behaviours (or _should_ affect the behaviors)  For example:\r\n\r\ndeptype=build: (4), (2)\r\ndeptype=link: (3)\r\ndeptype=run: (1)\r\n\r\nFinally, we need to figure out what, if anything, happens transitively.  If A->B->C, deptype(A->B)=x and deptype(B->C)=y, then how does that affect A's behavior?  There are only 3 deptypes, but now 9 combinations of 2-level transitive deptypes we have to decide upon.  Ideally, we won't need any special rules for transitive deptypes; but if we must, we must.\r\n\r\nIf we can get these right, then we have a definition of deptypes that we can rely upon and work with in cases like #3347.\r\n",
