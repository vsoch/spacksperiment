    "body": "This PR includes the following changes:\n1. Add packages for all of flake8's dependencies\n   - was previously downloading from PyPi\n2. Rename `py-pep8` to `py-pycodestyle`\n   - pep8 module was renamed to pycodestyle [at Guido's request](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/466)\n3. Add latest version of `py-flake8`\n4. Switch flake8 download to GitHub \n   - PyPi URL no longer extrapolates\n5. Switch deptype for setuptools to nolink, add checks\n\nThe last change is the most important here. `py-flake8` (as well as `py-pyflakes` and `py-pycodestyle`) actually depend on `py-setuptools` at runtime. Otherwise, you get error messages like:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File: \"/usr/bin/flake8\", line 5, in <module>\n    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\nImportError: No module named pkg_resources\n```\n\nNow that the deptype is correct, you can't activate `py-flake8` without also activating `py-setuptools`. Unfortunately, this doesn't help people who don't activate their Python packages. I added checks to `check_dependencies` to make sure setuptools is available before running `run-flake8-tests`. Let me know if you can think of a better way to do this.\n",
