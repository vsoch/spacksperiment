    "body": "@Exteris @tgamblin \r\n\r\nThere has been talk of Cythonizing Spack.  If it were to be done, Spack would become harder to install.  Most likely, we would then have two levels of Spack --- a \"slow/less capable\" bootstrap Spack in pure Python, and a complete Spack that uses Cython, compiled modules, etc.  One of the first things users would need to do (or Spack would do itself) is to bootstrap up to the complete Spack from the bootstrap Spack.\r\n\r\nThis is all possible, but adds complexity.  And maybe we will do it some day.  But so far, I believe that slowness is not a core problem; although sometimes we perceive it to be.\r\n\r\nI do think it would be worthwhile thinking through how our design would change if we had a really fast concretizer (say, sub-second performance on a 100-package DAG).\r\n",
