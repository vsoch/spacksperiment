    "body": "The current version of openmpi gets configuration errors when the schedulars=slurm this is due to notbeing able to find the pmi library.  And as it turns out you will get execution errors from slurm that it is not using its own pmi library.  So I created the slurm requirement and pointed to slurm to show where to get the pmi library.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I got build errors when the fabrics=mxm due to not having the libiberty library available and added the binutils+libiberty dependency.",
