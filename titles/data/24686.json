    "body": "When using Python 3.9.6, Spack is no longer able to fetch anything. Commands like `spack fetch` and `spack install` all break.\r\n\r\nPython 3.9.6 includes a [new change](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25853/files#diff-b3712475a413ec972134c0260c8f1eb1deefb66184f740ef00c37b4487ef873eR462) that means that `scheme` must be a string, it cannot be None. The solution is to use an empty string like the method default.\r\n\r\nFixes #24644. Also see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/80175 where this issue was discovered by CI. Thanks @branchvincent for reporting such a serious issue before any actual users encountered it!",
