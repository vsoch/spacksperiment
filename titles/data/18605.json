    "body": "I have a few questions regarding `spack`\r\n\r\n1. Does it support various flags that the portage package manager supports, for example USE flags and all the other flags? In other words is `spack` just as powerful as the portage package manager?\r\n2. Can I install applications in the root area where normal package managers (such as `pacman`) does for various applications such as `firefox`?\r\n3. If question 2 is true, can I use it as a replacement of other package managers such as `pacman`, for example if I have `firefox` already installed by `pacman`, I can update it via `spack`?",
