    "body": "I use spack to build htop on one of my CentOS 7 systems and it works Just Fine(tm).\r\n\r\nI'm moving onto a fancier, newer CentOS 7 system and I noticed that the spack built htop doesn't have any text in the bottom half.  It doesn't seem to be a color scheme issue (e.g. background == foreground).\r\n\r\nI noticed that it's linking against the system ncurses library:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[hartzelg@lb093login spack]$ ldd opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-5.4.0/htop-2.0.2-khg4zvn6noskhbmhsbysa5bmyo24u2nf/bin/htop\r\n\tlinux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00002aaaaaaab000)\r\n\tlibncursesw.so.5 => /lib64/libncursesw.so.5 (0x00002aaaaaabf000)\r\n\tlibtinfo.so.5 => /lib64/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00002aaaaacf7000)\r\n\tlibm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00002aaaaaf21000)\r\n\tlibc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00002aaaab224000)\r\n\tlibdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00002aaaab5e6000)\r\n\t/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x0000555555554000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is weird because a) the package says it depends on ncurses and b) my less-new CentOS 7 system links against the spack ncurses like it should.\r\n\r\nI ran `spack configure htop` and was trawling through the `config.log` file and noticed that when configure is probing for ncurses and looking at the spack copy it fails.\r\n\r\nHere is [a gist of the relevant part of the config.log](https://gist.github.com/hartzell/35c9ddacaf6e1944799ab9f984c35ed4).\r\n\r\nI'm [temporarily] out of ideas and am hoping that someone in Spack-land might be able to take a swing with the clue-bat.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n**Thanks!**",
