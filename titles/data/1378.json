ITAC isn't installing properly with cluster studio\n3.    The ~mpi variant still installs MPI components\n4.    The license file also needs to be symlinked in the itac/intel64 directory\n\nThis addresses issues 1, 2, and 4. For issue 3, it doesn't look like we can install the compilers without the MPI components. We could, however, manually remove them after the installer is run. @glennpj @adamjstewart let me know what you think.\n",
