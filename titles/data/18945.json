    "body": "These patch releases address a lot of CVEs and are more specific about numpy/scipy dependencies. Scipy is not a required dependency (it is only needed for testing), and numpy 1.19 is not yet compatible. We already fixed the numpy dependency version in a previous PR, so this only updates the scipy dependency. I haven't gotten a chance to test this yet, but hopefully someone else can verify that it builds successfully.",
