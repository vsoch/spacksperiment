    "body": "@adamjstewart \nRecent changes to CGAL (2015-09-22) added a bunch of new REQUIRED dependencies that are not in fact required.  I know the docs are fuzzy on this issue; but see section \"7 CGAL Libraries\" here:  http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html\n\nYes, Qt5 is required if you want to run demos.  OpenGL is required if you want to read/write images.  But only GMP and MPFR are required to build core CGAL.\n\nIn general... extra dependencies beyond what is required for a library's core functionality should almost always be added as Spack variants.  If people are already using a package successfully, and the package is not mistakenly linking to system libraries, then you can assume that dependencies not listed are not required for core functionality.\n\nI believe this needs to be sorted out for CGAL.  Until then I'm reverting back to the pre-Sep 22 version for my own use.  I cannot afford to build the world, I don't have enough inodes for that.\n",
