    "body": "Close #4480: This adds a workflow section on how to use spack on Docker.\r\n\r\nIt provides an example on the best-practices I collected over the last months and circumvents the common pitfalls I tapped in.\r\n\r\nWorks with MPI, CUDA, Modules, execution as root, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give it a swing, I pushed [an image](https://github.com/ax3l/dockerfiles/tree/master/spack/base) (without CUDA but MPI capable) of the latest `dev` to dockerhub. Just run\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run -it ax3l/spack\r\n```\r\n\r\nand do `spack ...` magic!\r\n\r\nNote: For the pushed image above, I already added a bit of convenience (+380MB) such as an editor, openssh server for MPI, installed `tar` via spack, etc. If you want to set up a CI job I would recommend to keep it more minimal, see the example for the docs in this PR.\r\n\r\nSetting up a regularly pushed, minimal `spack:develop` image would be a great thing, since it helps a lot to check and fix package build errors.\r\n\r\nHappy shipping! \ud83d\udea2 \r\n\r\nBackground: developed initially for [PIConGPU](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu/tree/dev/share/picongpu/dockerfiles). Here are [more spack based dockerfiles](https://github.com/ax3l/dockerfiles/tree/master/spack) of mine.\r\n\r\nP.S. Works also splendit on Singularity with docker image import.\r\n```\r\nBootstrap: docker\r\nFrom: ax3l/spack:latest\r\n\r\n%runscript\r\nexec /bin/bash -l\r\n```",
