    "body": "...on making your software easier to build.  This is an outline for a proposed section of the docs.  Please comment/add as appropriate.\r\n\r\n1. Use a standard build system: CMake, Autotools, Python setuputils, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Do not require any env vars to be set at runtime.  If your package needs to know where other packages are, set that at build time and \"bake it in\" when you install.\r\n\r\n3. Do not assume that different libraries or packages will be installed in the same tree (NetCDF + NetCDF-Fortran, I'm looking at you...)\r\n\r\n4. Do not try to fetch or auto-build any dependencies.  Just build yourself, and make it clear what your dependencies are.\r\n\r\n5. Check your resulting binaries with `ldd` to see if you've missed any dependencies.\r\n\r\n6. Submit a Spack package for your project.  If you use CMake, use that package to drive your development from the beginning, with `spack setup`.\r\n\r\n7. Do not change or add to your installation directory after you install; for example, do not install \"extra modules\" after-the-fact.  Extra modules should be installed as separate projects.\r\n\r\n8. Do not download anything as part of your build/install process.  If you have multiple tarballs, Spack has no problem installing them all as separate projects with declared dependencies.\r\n\r\n9. Once you release a tarball under a particular URL, do not later release a different tarball under the same URL.\r\n\r\n10. When appropriate, keep old releases around.  This should not preclude from removing tarballs with known vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n11. If you use GitHub, be aware that GitHub can create tarballs on-the-fly, based on just a tag.  Consider that the easiest way to release a tarball is to just add a tag to your git repo.\r\n\r\n11. If you package is header-only, you still need to write a build process to install it.  Consider using CMake for that task.\r\n",
