    "body": "This PR adds R packages for interacting with databases. There are several new packages including some non-R dependencies and a binutils patch. \n\nThe binutils patch is necessary to update symbols and set the default version when there are multiple versions set, as is the case with libmysqlclient.so. \n\nhttps://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=544ddf9322b1b83982e5cb84a54d084ee7e718ea\n\nIt will be necessary to rebuild binutils-2.26 for clients linked with libmysqlclient.so to work.\n\nThe libaio package was added as a dependency for mariadb. This is Linux only so it was handled in the same way as libpciaccess for Mac, #257.\n",
