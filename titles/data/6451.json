    "body": "Some improvements for the `module` command detection and execution:\r\n1. Function `get_module_cmd_from_bash()` is agnostic to the naming format of environment variables that are used for storing of shell functions (i.e. `$BASH_FUNC_module()` or `$BASH_FUNC_module%%`).\r\n2. Added support for the case when shell function `module` is defined with shell variables that are set in the bash initialization scripts but not exported.\r\n3. Added support for old versions of Tcl Environment Modules, which generate incorrect python scripts (e.g. `exec '/tmp/modulescript_12345_00'`).\r\n4. Argument `bashopts`, which was used only for testing, is removed from the function ~`get_module_cmd_from_bash()`~`get_module_cmd()`.",
