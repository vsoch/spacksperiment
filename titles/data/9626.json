    "body": "Add a command (maybe called `spack mark`) that lets you mark a package as implicit.  The command could also be extended to do the inverse (which currently can be accomplished by installing the exact package spec again).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nI was \"manually\" installing a bunch of packages that were failing to build whilst creating the package for `kitty`.  So now I have a bunch of packages that are really implicit dependencies on `kitty` that are marked explicit and show up when I run `spack find -e`.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA command that would mark in Spack internal db that a package is in fact implicit, rather than explicit (or vice-versa).  Strawman example uses: `spack mark implicit emacs@26.1`,  `spack mark explicit pkg-config`.",
