    "body": "- previous removal of FOAM_EXT_LIBBIN (ThirdParty) from the environment\r\n  during the build could lead to the system scotch library being found\r\n  instead of the spack installation.\r\n\r\n  Avoid this largely cosmetic change to the setting in favour of\r\n  improved build robustness. These modifications will be largely\r\n  superfluous in the 1812 release anyhow.\r\n\r\n- Split the patching algorithm into 'regular' and '@:1806' since the\r\n  next versions of openfoam will again need fewer patches.\r\n\r\n- Add hook into foamCreateManpage to be used where available",
