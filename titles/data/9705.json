(This appears to be similar to #9677, although the actual error messages are different.)  There is a newer version of numba available that does build against 3.7.x.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add the new numba version and then appropriate `depends_on('python@...)` calls for each version.  Pull request will be coming shortly.",
