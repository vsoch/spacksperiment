    "body": "See: https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/7855\r\n\r\nRecent versions of pkgconfig (and pkgconf) check `CPATH` as part of system include paths. Generally Spack unsets `CPATH` but allows package-specific updates to `CPATH` after clearing it. https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/7818 updates `CPATH` for `freetype` specifically (presumably to help some other package that isn't `py-matplotlib` build).\r\n\r\nThis provides a means to ensure that when Spack-built `pkg-config` is invoked that it unsets `CPATH` unless `spack env/install` was invoked with `--dirty`. This requires modifying the `pkgconf`/`pkg-config` providers since they can be invoked indirectly as part of a build.",
