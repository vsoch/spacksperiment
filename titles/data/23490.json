Please describe it!*-->\r\nIt may be viable to never allow a package to use a specific library version for various reasons. Sometimes libraries gets released which then turns out to break API/ABI and a new release is made soon after. But this is not always apparent to end-users or package maintainers.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!--*Describe the solution you'd like and the alternatives you have considered.*-->\r\n\r\nFrom the [spec dependency list](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#specs-dependencies).\r\nFor instance to select a version between 1.2 and 1.4, but not 1.3.2 one would do:\r\n```\r\n# current syntax\r\nmpileaks @1.2:1.3.1,1.3.3:1.4 %gcc@4.7.5 +debug -qt target=x86_64 ^callpath @1.1 %gcc@4.7.2\r\n# suggested syntax\r\nmpileaks @1.2:1.4,!1.3.2 %gcc@4.7.5 +debug -qt target=x86_64 ^callpath @1.1 %gcc@4.7.2\r\n```\r\nSince you are already using `^` and `~` it is best if `!` would be used for this (it seems).\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
