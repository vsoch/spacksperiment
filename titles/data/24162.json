    "body": "Currently, autotools packages use the inject flag handler, essentially ignoring the provided flags most of the time. For example, `spack install coreutils cflags=-Os cxxflags=-Os` simply builds `coreutils` with the default flags of `-O2 -g`.\r\n\r\nMoreover, packages providing their own `flag_handler` often provide build system flags, overriding the defaults. For instance, `xerces-c` sets std flags, disabling any optimizations.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses a hybrid approach by using the build system flag handler by default and, in case packages provide their own `flag_handler`, pass workaround flags via the injection mechanism and passing explicit flags via the build system flags.\r\n\r\nI haven't tested all modified packages yet but the ones that I tested seemed to build fine.",
