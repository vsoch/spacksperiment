Found a few more bugs to fix:\n- Grammar mistakes in Basic Usage\n- Broken link in Packaging Guide\n- Replaced `--force` and `--profile` with `-f` and `-p`\n  - I actually wanted all of them to be the long name, but Sphinx messes them up in the [Command Index](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_index.html). It's formatting the double dash as an en-dash because it doesn't keep the double backticks formatting.\n\n@citibeth @tgamblin \n",
