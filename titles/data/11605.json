    "body": "I would like to contribute a new package to SPACK called ELSI.\r\n\r\n[ELSI](https://wordpress.elsi-interchange.org/) provides a unified interface for electronic structure codes to a variety of eigenvalue solvers. Since ELSI is a wrapper, SPACK makes it much easier to use by installing its many dependencies.\r\n\r\nFor a number of different options, I ended up using a pattern:\r\n` if '+enable_myoption' in self.spec:\r\n     args += [\"-DENABLE_MYOPTION=ON\"]`\r\nin order to translate options to CMake arguments. If there is an automatic way to do this, please let me know and I will make the change.",
