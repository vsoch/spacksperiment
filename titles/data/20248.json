I want to set up a local Spack mirror, so that the lengthy download turns into a local copy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that the Spack `cuda` package cannot be mirrored:\r\n```sh\r\n$ spack mirror create -d $HOME/spack-mirror cuda\r\n==> Error: There are no valid versions for cuda that match ':'\r\neschnett@redshift:~/src/spack (10:36:35)\r\n$ spack mirror create -d $HOME/spack-mirror cuda@11.1.0\r\n==> No safe (checksummed) versions for package cuda\r\n==> Successfully updated mirror in file:///Users/eschnett/spack-mirror\r\n  Archive stats:\r\n    0    already present\r\n    0    added\r\n    0    failed to fetch.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, the safe (checksummed) versions are there in principle, but Spack doesn't see them because the `cuda` package creates the versions and checksums at run time.\r\n",
