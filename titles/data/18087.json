    "body": "Added newer versions for cppzmq (4.3.0 was 2+ years old). All new versions were tested on gcc@9.3.0 (ubuntu 20.04) against current release/v0.15 (v0.15.4).\r\n\r\nFor cppzmq@4.3.0:, cppzmq runs unit tests at the end of the build. Each of these versions has been confirmed to build against each of the libzmq@4.2.5: versions in release/v0.15 (and develop, for that matter). That has allowed the relaxing of depends_on('libzmq@4.2.5', when='@4.3.0'), which were the most recent versions at the time cppzmq@4.3.0 was added (#9682).\r\n\r\nFor cppzmq@4.2.2:4.2.3 there are no unit tests, and I elected to leave the version pinning unchanged. In addition to not being able to rely on unit tests, since libzmq@4.2.2 conflicts with %gcc@8: I was also unable to easily test whether cppzmq@4.2.2:4.2.3 compiles with any newer libzmq.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR accompanies bug report #18086 in the dependency resolution for which this is a workaround.",
