    "body": "I've noticed some unexpected behavior if an environment (or rather its view) contains two packages that have file conflicts, but do not conflict themselves. More specifically, `metis` and `scotch^+metis` both provide `include/metis.h` but do not conflict otherwise - it's perfectly possible  to add both to an environment and install it, without Spack complaining at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, the files are _not_ directly compatible and while METIS' `metis.h` should be useable with `scotchmetis` (that's the recommended way by Scotch), the converse is not true and SCOTCH's `metis.h` does not contain all functions METIS offers, rendering METIS impaired.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you remove `scotch` from the environment afterwards, the conflicting files will be deleted and any install command afterwards will error like this:\r\n```\r\n===> Error: /mypathtospack/var/spack/environments/myenv/.spack-env/include/metis.h is not a link tree!\r\n```\r\nThis seems to be a result of spack assuming that these files should exist if `metis` were installed properly. The situation is identical between `parmetis` and `spack` with their respective overlap.\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n```\r\nspack env create myenv\r\nspack env activate myenv\r\nspack add metis parmetis scotch\r\nspack install\r\n```",
