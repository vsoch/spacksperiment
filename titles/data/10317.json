    "body": "This is presumable already available in Spack. I'm just having a hard time understanding how to implement it. So I apologize ahead of time if this isn't an appropriate ticket. However, I have a use case which is relevant to Core packages in lmod that I want to get your advice on.\r\n\r\nSay I want to treat singularity or java-jdk as a core module. I figured out how to do that using white / black listing in the modules.yaml.\r\n\r\nIn the case of singularity, I want to move singularity images to a desired location within the lmod software stack, then generate a lua files underneath the core singularity which simply points to the container path. Idea being that I could organize singularity files under a hierarchical lmod structure. The issue is I'm not clear on how I can just move the file or generate an appropriate lua file using spack as the methods all appear to be oriented around autoreconf and actual builds. I guess I need the flexibility to do essentially less than that. I can do it manually, but once I update or delete the lmod tree, I lose my manually generated lua files. \r\n\r\nSimilarly for java-jdk. I want to take a build directory or even a compiled jar file, place it into a location with within the software stack for java-jdk and generate a lua file that just references the location of the file or root folder.\r\n",
