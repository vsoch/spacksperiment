    "body": "@adamjstewart @healther \r\n\r\nThis PR makes #7103 optional.  I believe #7103 is not a good idea for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. It is not the way the Python distro does things.   `python3` is the standard name for the Python3 executable, and `python`, according to the standard, always means Python2.  By default, Spack installations should conform to the standard.\r\n\r\n2. It does weird things to my Spack.  Consider what I did:\r\n   1. Download Spack, start using it.  (Spack running with my System's /usr/bin/ptyhon).\r\n   2. Install my software stack, which includes Python3\r\n   3. Do a `module load` of my software stack.\r\n   4. All of a sudden, the `spack` command is now running with Python3, not Python2.  What horrible inconsistencies might that cause, AFTER I've built a lot of stuff?  (To be fair, Spack works with Python3 too.  But it still makes me nervous).\r\n\r\n3. It breaks some builds.  I have builds that assume, as per the standard, that  \"python\" means Python2.  (Admittedly, these builds should probably be fixed to use the `python2` executable).\r\n\r\nAnyway... I think it's best to leave the symlinking as optional.  So now there's a `python+symlink` variant.\r\n",
