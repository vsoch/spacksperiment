Spack fails to install openssl on such a system because it requires a ping of the download url.  The error is:\n\n```\n% spack install -v openssl%gcc\n==> Error: Class constructor failed for package 'openssl'.\n\nCaused by:\nIOError: [Errno socket error] [Errno 101] Network is unreachable\n```\n\nI can hack the `openssl/package.py` to make it work, but I think there should be a requirement that packages work for offline machines.\n\nComments?\n",
