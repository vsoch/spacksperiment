This however doesn't return very useful hits. At least not a definition of variant and how to use it.\r\n\r\nThe first hit is the spack packages API doc list and the only appearances of variant I can see is in reference to tests..\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just wanted to start a discussion about this and see if anybody knew how to make this search function better. At this time I have no idea how to do it.",
