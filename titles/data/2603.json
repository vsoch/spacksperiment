If it looks like I ripped off your code, you're probably right....\r\n\r\nThis is where someone is bound to point out the existing ways to achieve this.... ;)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what documentation additions to make.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to the modules generation process to blacklist\r\npackages that were installed implicitly.  One can still whitelist\r\nmodules that were installed implicitly.\r\n\r\nThis changes adds a `blacklist_implicts` boolean as a peer to the\r\n`whitelist` and `blacklist` arrays, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodules:\r\n  enable::\r\n    - lmod\r\n  lmod:\r\n    whitelist:\r\n      - 'lua'\r\n      - 'py-setuptools'\r\n    blacklist:\r\n      -  '%gcc@4.8.3'\r\n    blacklist_implicits: True\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt adds a small helper in `spec.py` and then touches up the package\r\nfiltering code in `modules.py`.",
