To download the source it uses a login password, but if I got it right anyone can ask for it for non-commercial uses.\r\n\r\nI did not test all the possible installation, just `gcc` with and without `tcl`/`python` interfaces and `fftw=3`,\r\nand `intel` with `intel-mpi` and `fftw=mkl`\r\nIn both case with `charm backend=mpi`\r\n\r\nWhile testing this package for intel tools (compiler, mpi, mkl), I add to tweak the package `charm` and `intel-mpi`.\r\n\r\nIt should be only additions and corrections on the way the backends where checked. @eschnett can you check that I did not break anything in `charm` ?\r\nFor `intel-mpi` @davydden and @alalazo you are the one that wrote it.\r\n",
