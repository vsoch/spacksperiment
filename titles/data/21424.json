    "body": "Hey lovely folks! This is my first PR in spack. I think I found a race condition when packages get uninstalled which should be fixed with this PR:\r\n\r\nWhen uninstalling packages, spack also tries to remove empty parent directories of the install prefix up until the spack installation root.  Spack acquires a write lock for the package's installation prefix during uninstallation. However, multiple installation prefixes can share parent directories. So there's a race condition when trying to remove empty parent directories.\r\n\r\nThis sporadically occurs in our jenkins setup where we uninstall a package in 4 configurations roughly at the same time.",
