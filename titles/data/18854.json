    "body": "<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2. Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install cpio@2.13%intel  cflags=\"-gcc-name=/usr/bin/gcc\" cxxflags=\"-gxx-name=/usr/bin/g++\" fflags=\"-gcc-name=/usr/bin/gcc\" \r\n```\r\nfails with errors like\r\n```console\r\n     823     In file included from /usr/include/bits/floatn.h(119),\r\n     824                      from /usr/include/stdlib.h(55),\r\n     825                      from ./stdlib.h(36),\r\n     826                      from /tmp/spackswinst/spack-stage/spack-stage-cpio-2.13-7pkcw3laom5ujrw5ho2wwrquil6w23p7/spack-src/gnu/argp-parse.c(26):\r\n  >> 827     /usr/include/bits/floatn-common.h(214): error: invalid combination of type specifiers\r\n     828       typedef float _Float32;\r\n```\r\n\r\nGoogling the error I came across \r\nhttps://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/issues/10932\r\nwhich seems to suggest the inclusion of a --no-gcc flag, while perhaps needed on older versions of the intel compiler, is not needed on recent versions.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n```console\r\n> spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-ivybridge\r\n```\r\nThe system gcc being referenced in the flags in the spac install command are for gcc@8.3.1 \r\nsupplied by RHEL8 (and are likely not needed as that is what would default to).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5258285/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5258286/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\nNo maintainers\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
