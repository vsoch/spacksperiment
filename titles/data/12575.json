    "body": "Currently, the python `add_files_to_view` method attempts to get the real path from the prefix to a file using `os.path.realpath`. However, that only works if the prefix itself is not under a symlink. If the prefix itself is under a symlink, the entire `merge_map` is created relative to that link.\r\n\r\nBy computing `os.path.realpath` of both the file and the python prefix, we can use `os.path.relpath` to compute the real relative path from the python prefix to the file, and prepend that with the python prefix to get the value we should expect in our `merge_map`.\r\n\r\nTested with `python@3.7` in a stack with a managed view. Spack could not link Python into the view without this change, and now can.",
