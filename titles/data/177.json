Have you seen it before, or can you give me a pointer?\n\nThe system has gcc 4.9.2 installed; I am trying to install gcc 5.2 via Spack. This looks as if it was using Spack's `binutils` package.\n\nGoogle didn't find any good answers. Apart from \"don't mess with your system\", there is one message suggesting to build `ld` with the `--with-sysroot` option. However, `--with-sysroot` expects a path as argument, and it's unclear to me what argument that could be. I also don't understand what Spack is trying to achieve by using the `--sysroot` argument.\n\n```\nconfigure:4370: checking for C compiler default output file name\nconfigure:4392: /xfs1/eschnetter/src/spack/lib/spack/env/cc    conftest.c  >&5 /xfs1/eschnetter/src/spack/opt/spack/linux-x86_64/gcc-4.9.2/binutils-2.25-gqbrzkvzz2q236u5tkyo7uxn2u5i5b4q/bin/ld: this linker was not configured to use sysroots\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n```\n",
