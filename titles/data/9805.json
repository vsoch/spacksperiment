This is because I've included an initial [commit](be179569b89b4cae4d352702b82413ac2dbc16ca) that removes a troublesome section of the travis file.  [Here](https://travis-ci.org/opadron/spack/jobs/453687889) is the log of a travis job that ran on the tip of this branch off of my fork.\r\n\r\nThese results show that 1 - the original issue from #9658 is not related to docker, and is a distinct issue that needs to be addressed, and 2 - the changes in this PR, other than the initial commit, are all that should be necessary for the `docker` stage to produce working images.  I haven't tested pushing to dockerhub, but I don't think it will be an issue.",
