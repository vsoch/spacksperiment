    "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nOur group is working on continuous integration (CI) and wondering if there is a \"spack\" method for finding the module file for a package.   The scenario would be that one phase of the CI would build the package or packages with spack, the test phase would need to load the spack module(s) and run tests.  Is there an automated way to find the module file for the package built in the previous build phase?  We could list all the module files and search for the package and use shell commands to parse out the module file names, but that doesn't seem very elegant, but maybe necessary.   Is there a suggested or better way?  I thought I would ask before trying to implement something.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJim G.",
