This is the default version on summit and we have used 10.1 to successfully build ascent + vtk-m.\r\n- This removes `vtk-m@ascent_ver`, since non-numeric versions are very difficult to wield\r\n- This limits the issue in #22459 to only apply to mfem 4.1 (where the BOM bytes exist in the mfem release)\r\n- This removes a few version constraint forwarding statements from package.py files (we expect to suggest usable combos in spack envs)\r\n",
