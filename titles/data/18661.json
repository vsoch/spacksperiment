    "body": "Some packages define variant defaults that are unparsable from CLI, for instance empty tuples. This PR:\r\n- [x] Add a unit test to check if there are unparsable defaults\r\n- [x] Fix 'rust' and 'nsimd' variants\r\n\r\nThe approach taken here is not to modify variants in core Spack to add more checks or type-structure, but instead try to catch problematic defaults with unit tests. This was done considering that out of the thousands packages we now have, only 2 of them seemed to have defaults which can't be parsed from the command line. If necessary though, more structured solutions can be implemented.\r\n\r\n",
