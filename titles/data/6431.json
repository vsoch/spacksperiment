    "body": "This is a follow-up to #6346 to add NetCDF support.\r\n\r\nWhile technically it is an optional dependency, the Siesta documentation recommends its use because it makes a number of additional features available and speeds up others. So I decided not to make this a Spack variant but a hard dependency.\r\n\r\nThe configure script has trouble when multiple libraries are specified with `--with-netcdf`, so I had to include a patch. This patch also removes an outdated reference to `libnetcdf_f90.a` from the generated configuration, which otherwise causes build errors.",
