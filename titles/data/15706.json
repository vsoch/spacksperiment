However, the [documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_systems/autotoolspackage.html) states that the `autoreconf` phase includes running `aclocal`. The debug file shows that `autoreconf` did run but `aclocal.m4` is not updated (its timestamp is 2019-09-06). I cannot tell whether it is a bug in `autoreconf` phase or `aclocal` only runs when `aclocal.m4` is not present. If I add `force_autoreconf = True` to the recipe, `aclocal.m4` is updated and installation is successful.\r\n\r\nIf the `force_autoreconf` setting is indeed required, I can create a pull request to fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
