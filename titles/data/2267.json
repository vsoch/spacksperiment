    "body": "@tgamblin wrote in #2189 \r\n\r\n> You really should read the PRs about how locking is done in Spack, because it took me a long time to work out how to do that, and I think it's pretty good. On modern filesystems, it does work, with fcntl locks, for multiple users, with no special configuration. If you're skeptical, I'd encourage you to find a problem with the scheme. I don't think the solutions you're suggesting are in line with what Spack's audience is willing/able to set up.\r\n\r\nCan this get documented?  Or collect a list of PRs from which relevant documentation could later be extracted?  I have exactly the same need elsewhere; can I just use `llnl/util/lock.py`?\r\n",
