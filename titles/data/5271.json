    "body": "The perllocal.pod files list and describe non-core packages installed by users; they are not used by perl itself. In a normal perl installation, the perllocal.pod files are appended when new packages are installed. Under spack, perl packages each create their own perllocal.pod file. During package activation, the multiple perllocal.pod files conflict with each other, so that only one perl package can be activated at any time.\r\n\r\nThe solution proposed here ignores the perllocal.pod files during package activation, using code derived from the python package. We choose not to merge the files, as is done for some files in python packages, because they are not required for correct operation of perl and ignoring them is much simpler.",
