Hopefully, this will be consistent going forward.\r\n- Set an explicit url for the previous beta version.\r\n- Accept values for `cuda_arch`. The previous version had its own list\r\n  but the release version does not.\r\n- Replace the built in cuda compute capabilities list with the one\r\n  provided by Spack for the 3.10beta version.",
