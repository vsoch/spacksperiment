Can you submit a new PR with a fix?\r\n\r\nIn particular, I think this should not be as aggressive when the completion file isn't present but the database says the package is installed.  That causes it to try to rebuild things that users have already installed.  I realize that eventually there are going to be completion files in all the `.spack` directories, but we need something to transition people smoothly.",
