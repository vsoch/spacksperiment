    "body": "Open MPI has been relying on versions of PMIx since the 2.0.0\r\nrelease.  Although the embedded version can be used, it makes\r\nmore sense long term for Spack to know about the PMIx package,\r\nand to build Open MPI against PMIx as an external package.\r\n\r\nThere are other software components that may eventually be\r\nreliant on PMIx including MPICH, GASNet, the OpenSHMEM reference\r\nimplementation, etc.\r\n\r\nThis is also partly motivated by the desire to have ECP ST\r\nprojects be released through Spack.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Howard Pritchard <howardp@lanl.gov>",
