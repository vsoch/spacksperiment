    "body": "When installing the default HDF5 (with defaults: `+fortran`, `+mpi`) with `clang@4.0.1` (and `gfortran@5.4.0` as `FC`), the linking of `libhdf5_fortran` fails on a missing `-lnuma` with the default `openmpi@2.1.1` during the `build` stage.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack install hdf5 %clang@4.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes it by adding `numactl` which ships `libnuma`.\r\n\r\nNote: Installs without MPI or Fortran succeeded already, so I only added it on `+mpi+fortran`.\r\n```bash\r\nspack install hdf5~mpi %clang@4.0.1\r\nspack install hdf5~fortran %clang@4.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [x] depends on ~~#5371~~",
