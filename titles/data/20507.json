    "body": "We have to repeat all the spec attributes in a number of places in `concretize.lp`, and Spack has a fair number of spec attributes. If we instead add some rules up front that establish equivalencies like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode(Package) :- attr(\"node\", Package).\r\nattr(\"node\", Package) :- node(Package).\r\n\r\nversion(Package, Version) :- attr(\"version\", Package, Version).\r\nattr(\"version\", Package, Version) :- version(Package, Version).\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can rewrite most of the repetitive condidions with `attr` and repeat only for each arity (there are only 3 arities for spec attributes so far) as opposed to each spec attribute. This makes the logic easier to read and the rules easier to follow.\r\n",
