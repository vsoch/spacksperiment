    "body": "When using the `spack spec` or `spack solve` commands there should be a way to see the test dependencies that are included with `spack install --test  root ...`\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nIt is often helpful to visualize what packages will be built if they are already installed, etc to make sure the packages.yaml file is set up right, or to further constrain things to avoid rebuilding already installed packages. Therefore also being able to see the test dependencies would be helpful.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSomething like `spack spec --install root mypackage` would be a reasonable starting point as it is consistent with `spack install --test root mypackage`\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2555-daebf5caf8\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-broadwell\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
