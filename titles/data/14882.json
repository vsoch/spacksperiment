    "body": "This PR allows qmcpack to be built with AFQMC support. \r\n\r\nI added all of the conflicts listed in the CMake files, namely with BUILD_AFQMC and BUILD_AFQMC_WITH_NCCL. If NCCL is requested, it will add nccl as as a dependency. \r\nAFQMC requires MPI, so it fails if you don't have +mpi when asking for +afqmc. \r\n\r\nThe compiler conflicts were told to me from the AFQMC developers, and even though AFQMC has been in QMCPACK for a few versions, they only recommended use from v3.7 and up. \r\n\r\nIf there are other conflicts/dependencies, they can be added later. For now, this should be sufficient to allow users to start building with AFQMC support\r\n\r\n@naromero77 \r\n\r\n",
