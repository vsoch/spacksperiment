    "body": "This re-writes sourceforge download URLs with a timestamp, so they actually download the archive rather than an HTML page.  It has a downside, in that the resulting archive name includes the timestamp, causing subsequent fetches not to find it.  Adding the timestamp does solve the download problem, but I would like to find a better way to integrate this change so as not to disrupt the naming/matching.\n\nfixes #59 \n",
