    "body": "### Rationale\r\n\r\nThere are some packages like `jdk` where the package can be automatically installed for Linux x86_64 but not macOS or aarch64. There are also some packages like `cuda` which don't define a `version(...)` at all on macOS but do on Linux x86_64, aarch64, and ppc64le.\r\n\r\nThe former example could be reformatted to look like the latter example. Or both examples could be modified by adding a `when=` kwarg to the `version()` directive. @alalazo and I have discussed this but apparently it's difficult to implement the latter.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nAnyway, regardless of which solution we end up using, the error message for packages which don't define any version on the current OS is very cryptic. On macOS:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install cuda\r\n==> Error: There are no valid versions for cuda that match ':'\r\n```\r\nThis has been documented in #4119 and #17512. If you also want to close these issues, we could detect when no valid versions are found for a package on the current OS and make that more clear using similar logic to what you added in this PR.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @adamjstewart in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/18242#issuecomment-682022236_",
