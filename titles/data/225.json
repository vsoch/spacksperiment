    "body": "The PR adds the dependency to curl and expat for https clone and pushes.\nThe variants just state that the version from spack should be used, if they are not used on and the system provides libcurl and libexpat the https support will still be activated.\n\nI also made the dependency with zlib and openssl interne to spack.\nFor zlib the dependency was already there but if the system also provide zlib it was linking with the system one.\n\nThis PR is complementary to the changes of @justintoo in PR #105.\n\nFor the curl packages added as a dependency, it is curl and libcurl that are build. I don't know if it is preferable to only install the libcurl and not the curl executable, since the system should already have curl in order to use spack.\n",
