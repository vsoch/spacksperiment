    "body": "This was created per #3222. The main driver was that Dyninst 9.3.0 required libelf.so.1, which is provided by the elfutils package. Dyninst previously depended on libelf, which only implements libelf.so.0. I also updated packages that depend on Dyninst and libelf and was able to get them to build in my environment. @tgamblin @mplegendre @pramodk @kserradell may want to verify that I didn't break anything they care about.\r\n\r\n@jgalarowicz and @schulzm, Open|Speedshop currently fixes its Dyninst dependency at 9.2.0, but when you upgrade to 9.3.0, you will need to modify your package. I put a comment in there accordingly.",
