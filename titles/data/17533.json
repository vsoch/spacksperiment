I noticed the `--fail-fast` argument seemed like it would be desirable here so my container build wouldn't no continue using cycles if it would ultimately fail.\r\n\r\n@alalazo - Hope you don't mind me pinging you on this since I've noticed you working on other `containerize` related efforts. If something with this approach isn't acceptable I understand and it can be ignored.",
