    "body": "Testing showed that buildcache install wants to download build dependencies as well and link and run dependencies. Changed buildcache install  to only install tarballs for link and run dependencies.\r\n\r\nTesting of relative rpath tarballs installation showed the relative rpaths were being replaced with absolute rpaths. Reworked the relative rpath tarball creation and installation to add and check for relativerpath flag in buildcache info file. \r\n\r\nReworked the macho object modification to be more like the elf object modification.\r\n\r\nChanged some warnings to failures when pgp2 is not avaiable or a key isn't available. The create command would complete making one think that the .spack files were created when only the .tar.gz files were created.\r\n\r\nFixed bug where files (and links) with with text in filename (eg libmathtext.a) were added to the list of text file to be relocated",
