Since the purpose is to be able to see this recipe in the latest Spack, I submitted a PR first, although it contains unresolved following issues.\r\nWe will update as soon as the problem is resolved.\r\n\r\n - about issue\r\nWhen building with the gcc compiler,'Werror' is added to FFLAGS.\r\nIn the case of using the gcc compiler and the default simulation settings, \r\nthere is the process which always causes array out-of-bounds reference error,\r\nand this is processed as error instead of warning.\r\nSo, temporarily set the gcc compiler as a conflict.\r\nThis issue is queried in the following:\r\nhttps://github.com/geodynamics/specfem3d_globe/issues/717",
