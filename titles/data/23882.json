    "body": "The current implementation is a hack.  I was bundling something:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack create https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/archive/refs/tags/v2.44.0.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now, v2.45.0 is Pre-Release.  So when I do the above, trying to skip 2.45, I'll ultimately be required to select the non-default of hash 2 versions to then delete 2.45.0.  I feel like spack already has some fancy stuff elsewhere in the library that either already has or could have the capability to gain additional information from GitHub archive urls.  I think skipping pre-releases specifically, if attainable and relatively straightforward is appropriate.  My current implementation was just a curiosity :slightly_smiling_face:  This can just as easily be closed since hopefully whoever is issuing `spack create` is paying attention.  But in theory, it could be done.  Should it?",
