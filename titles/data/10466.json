For instance, with the following `packages.yaml`, `cairo` ends up being concretized as `cairo~X+pdf`:\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  cairo:\r\n    variants: +pdf\r\n  all:\r\n    variants: +X\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure if there is a reason for the current behavior but this just bit me and caused a significant amount of debugging. :-)",
