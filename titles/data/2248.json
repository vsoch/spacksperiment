    "body": "@tgamblin @alalazo \r\nSee #2245 \r\n\r\nMy concern here is that different config file systems, authored by different Spackers, use different conventions.  `config.yaml` uses lower-case names with dollar signs, possibly surrounded by curly braces.  Module configuration uses upper-case names with dollar signs.  There is talk about maybe just using curly braces, not dollar signs.\r\n\r\nWhatever we decide... we should make sure that decision is implemented consistently across *all* Spack configuration files.",
