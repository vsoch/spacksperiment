    "body": "After migrating to `travis-ci.com`, we saw I/O issues in our tests -- tests that relied on `capfd` and `capsys` were failing.  We've also seen this in GitHub actions, and it's kept us from switching to them so far.\r\n\r\nTurns out that the issue is that using streams like `sys.stdout` as default arguments doesn't play well with `pytest` and output redirection, as `pytest` changes the values of `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`. if these values are evaluated before output redirection (as they are when used as default arg values), output won't be captured properly later.\r\n\r\n- [x] replace all stream default arg values with `None`, and only assign stream values inside functions.\r\n- [x] fix tests we didn't notice were relying on this erroneous behavior",
