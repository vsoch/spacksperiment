That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n[namd_stacktrace.log](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5067386/namd_stacktrace.log)\r\n[spack_debug_report.log](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5067387/spack_debug_report.log)",
