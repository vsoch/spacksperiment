The only way that I can get it to be a higher priority is to add it to the `defaults` scope but that does not seem like the right thing to do.\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack mirror list\r\nspack-public    https://spack-llnl-mirror.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/\r\n$ spack mirror add test file:///opt/mirror\r\n$ spack mirror list\r\nspack-public    https://spack-llnl-mirror.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/\r\ntest            file:///opt/mirror\r\n```\r\nDownloads will check the public mirror first.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.11.2-8577-8ad581e\r\n* **Python:** 2.7.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-skylake_avx512\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n",
