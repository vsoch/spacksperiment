Some versions are provided in the package definition, each specified by the commit's SHA1 that corresponds to tagged releases.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nSome of our applications (and maybe others as well) use this library. Having it available in `spack` eases management of external libraries, as everything can be managed via `spack`.\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\n- `spack install cln` works on my machine.\r\n- `spack flake8` passes on my machine.",
