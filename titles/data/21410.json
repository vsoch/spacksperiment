See the code [here](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/v0.16.0/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/cassandra/package.py#L18-L19) which is still using _alpha_ releases when _beta_ releases are already available.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack <command1> <spec>\r\n$ spack <command2> <spec>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output.

That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
