    "body": "When using shells other than bash, e.g., zsh, modules can only be\nsourced in the current shell. Bash has the module handling function\nexported into a bash-specific environment variable that will allow other\nbash run in subprocesses to inherit said function.\n\nHere I'm proposing to populate the environment for `/bin/bash` with said\nfunction in case the user runs a different shell. As mentioned in the\ncomments, this would require `modulecmd` to be found in PATH, which\nseems to be a reasonable assumption. This will make `module_cmd.load`\netc work for hopefully all shells, not just bash.\n",
