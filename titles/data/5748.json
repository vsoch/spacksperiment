I also tried it with ```db149876a42ec4cc8db9e488d90d71c7d811a7a6``` where it also fails. So the reason isn't in #5716, although I know that it worked at some point in August.\r\n\r\nThis is the error message:\r\n```\r\nConcretized\r\n--------------------------------\r\n==> Error: An unsatisfiable variant constraint has been detected for spec:\r\n\r\n    pcre@8.40%gcc@4.9.2~jit+utf arch=linux-debian8-x86_64 \r\n\r\n\r\nwhile trying to concretize the partial spec:\r\n\r\n    git@2.14.1%gcc@4.9.2 arch=linux-debian8-x86_64 \r\n\r\n\r\ngit requires pcre variant +jit, but spec asked for ~jit\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt fails with current ```develop``` (Time to fail: ~1:30), but doesn't fail when setting the defaults of ```pcre``` to ```+jit```.
