The reason for this behaviour appears to be https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/9ed34f686fc605d2e5dfbb15b14ed8d63fdb7c72/lib/spack/spack/fetch_strategy.py#L870 which archives the working tree instead of the git repo.\r\n\r\nOn a second note, the same source caching strategy seems to result in the following warning\r\n```\r\n==> Warning: Fetching from mirror without a checksum!\r\n  This package is normally checked out from a version control system, but it has been archived on a spack mirror.

As a package maintainer, should I be able to expect that the staged source directory (from a package with a git source) presents itself as a git repository clone even when staged from the cache? (=> If yes, consider this issue as a bug report, if no, consider this issue as resolved and thank you for clarifying the intended behaviour.)\r\n\r\n2. Regardless of the previous, would you consider accepting a contribution which changes the source caching strategy of the `GitFetchStrategy` to rather archive the git repo (just the `.git` directory without the working tree) and then reconstruct the working tree using the commit hash from the package spec? (=> Fixing the unsafe warning for that case.)\r\n\r\nCc: @ChristianTackeGSI",
