    "body": "This pull request adds a package for CUDA. At first glance, the following packages can now be modified to add CUDA support:\n- cbtf-argonavis\n- cbtf-krell\n- mvapich2\n- openspeedshop\n- opencv\n\nI'm not familiar with most of these packages, so I'll let someone else add CUDA support to these after this gets merged.\n#### Potential improvements that can be made:\n\nSimilar to #558, the runfile download must be done manually. What would be really cool would be to override whatever function attempts fetching and add a try/catch statement. If the package cannot be found (in this case meaning it is not in the current directory or in a mirror), then prompt the user letting them know that it needs to be manually downloaded.\n\nThis package does not handle driver installation. As far as I know, this needs to be done manually by disabling the Nouveau drivers and rebooting into text-mode (see [CUDA Installation Guide](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-getting-started-guide-for-linux/#runfile-installation)). Perhaps I could add a `+driver` variant that handles the driver installation as long as the user is already in text-mode.\n\nCUDA also suffers from the same problem as #558, in which the filename depends not only on the version but also on the platform and architecture. We could require users to rename the file without those, but the checksum will still be different.\n",
