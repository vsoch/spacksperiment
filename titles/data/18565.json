I believe the reason for this is that kokkos sets `OMPI_CXX=path/to/nvcc-wrapper`, so if the downstream project (like cabana) uses mpicxx, it'd use nvcc-wrapper underneath. However, cmake doesn't call mpicxx, it calls the regular host compiler (g++) which doesn't understand the nvcc flags, of course.\r\n\r\nI can work around it by adding\r\n```\r\n            '-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=%s' % (self.spec['mpi'].mpicxx),\r\n```\r\nto cabana's `package.py`, but the problem extends to other users of kokkos as well, so this doesn't seem like a great solution.\r\n\r\n@junghans \r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
