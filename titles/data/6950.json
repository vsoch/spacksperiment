    "body": "I am trying to build various libraries on an older RHEL system. The problem is I can't even get Perl to build. \r\n\r\nI do \r\n\r\n```\r\nspack build perl\r\n```\r\nand I get\r\n\r\n```\r\n./findhdr: line 14: /usr/local/bin/awk: Permission denied\r\n<stdarg.h> NOT found\r\n./findhdr: line 14: /usr/local/bin/awk: Permission denied\r\n<varargs.h> NOT found, but that's ok (I hope).\r\n*** WHOA THERE!!! ***\r\nYour C compiler \"cc\" doesn't seem to support stdarg or varargs!\r\n I'm giving up; maybe you can try again with a different compiler?\r\n```\r\nThis is on  RHEL, 2.6.32-696.el6.x86_64 with gcc 4.4.7.\r\n\r\nSo, it seems awk is a problem. But its only /usr/local/bin/awk that is a problem. I tried to do the following in compilers.yaml\r\n\r\n```\r\nenvironment:\r\n  set:\r\n     awk : /usr/bin/awk\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich doesn't fix the issue since the problem is in the Configure stage. So how do I tell it to use this path for awk during the configure stage. \r\n\r\n",
