    "body": "Fixes the duplicate boost patch issue initially reported in #5325 and discussed further in #5341.\r\nThese are the steps I had taken to address the issue:\r\n - I launched two isolated docker environments: one running Ubuntu 16.04 + GCC 5.4.0, and the other running Fedora 26 + GCC 7.2.1.  For details, see my Docker PR, #5871.\r\n - I installed boost without specifying any additional options: `$ spack install boost`.  Installation succeeded in both environments.\r\n - To reproduce the issue, I proceeded to install version `1.55.0`: `$ spack install boost@1.55.0`.  Installation failed in the Ubuntu environment, which is expected since it is running a version of GCC for which the duplicate patches were set to be applied.\r\n - I made the changes contained in this PR, with the guidance of @scheibelp.\r\n - After the changes were made, I tried building version `1.55.0` of boost, again.  The build succeeded in both environments.\r\n - I then confirmed that the single `call_once_variadic` patch is not applied in the Fedora environment, since the GCC it uses should be too new for it.",
