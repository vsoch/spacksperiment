    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nRegister a version of an external package in your `packages.yaml` that is not known (as `version(...)` line) to the builtin spack recipe. Mark the package as not build-able from source. Install the external version.\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nThis usually results in a silent concretization issue and confusing error message.\r\n\r\nIn the [CI example here](https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api/pull/723), registering an \"unknown\" perl version it led to the `spack spec adios2@2.5.0%gcc@9.3.0~mpi` output\r\n```\r\nInput spec\r\n--------------------------------\r\nadios2@2.5.0%gcc@9.3.0~mpi\r\n\r\nConcretized\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n==> Error: No compilers with spec gcc@7.4.0 found for operating system ubuntu18.04 and target x86_64.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nTravis CI on Ubuntu 18.04 (and older) with a multi-platform configuration, see https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-api/pull/723\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
