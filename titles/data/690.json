The py-pandas package had some dependencies that, as far as I can tell, are not needed. I also removed some other python dependencies that are optional according to the pandas project.\n\nhttp://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html\n\nI also added a couple of python packages that are recommended, one of which, py-bottleneck, is a new spack package.\n",
