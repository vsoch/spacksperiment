    "body": "This is a follow-up to #24236 \r\n\r\nOriginally, I thought `spack --print-shell-vars sh,modules` was slowing down my shell initialization times. I didn't realize that in the else-clause we also call `spack --print-shell-vars sh`. Both options only set variables related to modules, and I don't use modules, so these are entirely useless to me. With this PR, users who set `SPACK_SKIP_MODULES` will have significantly faster startup times, especially on clusters where Spack is slow to run.\r\n\r\n@michaelkuhn @eugeneswalker @alalazo @JBlaschke ",
