This means that this PR is currently broken and I'm not sure how to deal with this.\r\n\r\nI could handle this manually (as I had to do for the `meam` package which existed in the past) but that means having a variant name that doesn't match the corresponding LAMMPS package name which would be an exception. I don't see any other solution though...\r\n\r\nAny feedback would be appreciated.",
