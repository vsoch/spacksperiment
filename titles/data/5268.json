    "body": "- most compilers `#define linux 1`\r\n    - armadillo does raw pasting of include directories in code\r\n    - this means macro expansion of `linux-x86_64` -> `1-x86_64`\r\n- new version, previous download url seems broken\r\n- lib64 instead of lib?\r\n    - needs verification, was required for intel, works for others\r\n\r\nThis is some ridiculous hacking, but it seems to work.  This PR needs review over the patching, there **has** to be a better way to get the extracted archive directory....RIGHT????\r\n\r\nI found it by `__dict__` crawling.  Which is never exactly promising.\r\n\r\nFixes #2061 \r\nFixes #2808",
