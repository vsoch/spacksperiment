I assume I will download the tarball manually and then somehow point Spack to it.\r\n\r\nThe packaging guide has a section on \"licensed software\" <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#licensed-software>, but this seems to be something slightly different, namely software that requires a license to install or run.\r\n\r\nIf this is already documented, is there a particular keyword for which I should search?",
