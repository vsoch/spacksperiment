    "body": "nek5000's `prenek` needs to know the path to the `X.h` header provided by the `xproto` package.  This header typically exists in a system directory (`/usr/include/X11`).  If spack installs `libx11` then the install directory of `xproto` needs to be checked for the header.  This PR adds a check for the header and, if found, adds the path to the compile line.",
