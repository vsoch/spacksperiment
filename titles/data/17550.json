    "body": "spack info kallisto \r\nreports that kallisto depends on mpich.\r\n\r\nThis is surprising to me because it is not optional and specific to the mpich package (and not a dependency on the virtual MPI package).  But even more surprising, is I do not see any mention of kallisto supporting MPI.  I cannot find any mention of MPI in the source code, and the only MPI dependency appears to be indirect via hdf5 built with MPI support (see e.g. \r\nhttps://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto/issues/91)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2.
