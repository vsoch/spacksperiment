    "body": "Boost 1.69.0 has issues in a relatively low level header that cause compile warnings when a particular non-bundled warning (`-Wnon-virtual-dtor`) is activated. This can cause problems for downstream code that uses `-Werror`. This PR applies a pair of patches comprising the fixes for this issue that have already been applied to the `develop` branch of the relevant Boost package (`system`) and will be released with 1.70.0.",
