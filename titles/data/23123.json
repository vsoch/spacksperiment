    "body": "TL;DR: Is there interest in teaching new spack contributors more generally about build systems, and can we bring that into spack's contributor documentation?\r\n\r\nOne of the most fun experiences I've had with packaging software for Gentoo Linux was reading through their comprehensive [developer manual](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/) which extends the packaging mission of the Gentoo project to more generally teach you critical concepts about build systems.  For example they have a section that explains [GNU Autotools](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/autotools/index.html) which is one of the most succinct and useful references to remind oneself of how Autotools works and to reason about patching and troubleshooting errors.  On that page, you can see their rationale is:\r\n\r\n>  Finding and correcting build issues is often easier if the build system is not seen simply as a scary black box. \r\n\r\nCurrently, contributors to spack are slightly abstracted away from the build system, and we need to lower the barrier both of where to look for log files, how to make and test changes inside and outside of the `package.py`, and generally lower the expertise in the build system they are working on.\r\n\r\n1. Contributors may not have written the original build system of the project; turnover of developers is not unusual for academic software, and\r\n2. Contributors may primarily be researchers with a little bit of experience compiling software and may be motivated to use spack's dependencies and know python but lack expertise with build systems.\r\n\r\nI know when I started out with packaging software for Gentoo I was both learning the build system and the package manager at the same time.  It, of course, helps to read similar packaged software, but there is a gap to fill between the official build system documentation and reading similar work.\r\n\r\nI feel like this might be a fun thing to do as a group at a hackathon / codeathon.",
