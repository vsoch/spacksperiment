    "body": "Ping @srekolam. Currently builds of hip result in shared libs having suffixes like `libamdhip.so.x.y.z-` with a trailing dash. This is because hip insists on using git to set the patch version number. The problem is there is no git repo to use when downloading tarballs. This resulted in build errors in some cases when using targets from `hip-config.cmake`.\r\n\r\nUpstream PR: https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/pull/2218",
