You don't have to be a Spack expert, it just gives us someone to ping when users report build issues or submit PRs related to R or R packages. You can also choose to maintain only a subset of R packages if you don't want to maintain all of them.\r\n\r\nPinging some other known Spack + R users: @HenrikBengtsson @JavierCVilla @codeandkey @odoublewen @hartzell @cosmicexplorer \r\n\r\nSome ideas for future work related to R:\r\n\r\n* Create a `cran` attribute similar to #17587 to simplify homepage/url/list_url\r\n* Add package tests similar to #20023 to test installations\r\n* Create bundle packages for Bioconductor so you can install `bioconductor@3.12`\r\n* Automate adding new packages/versions or integrate with the builtin package manager\r\n\r\nP.S. If you get a chance, take a look at https://github.com/spack/spack/labels/r and see if you can close any of these issues",
