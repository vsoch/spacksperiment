    "body": "This is an update for NetCDF.\r\n\r\nThere are several questions that need to be answered before this gets merged:\r\n\r\n1. There was a workaround introduced by @adamjstewart in #1553. Do we still need it? I tried to run the commands from the discussion and they seem to work.\r\n2. What do we do with options 'parallel4' and 'pnetcdf'? Should it be just one option 'mpi' that enables both parallel I/O features? If not, what should be the default values for these variants? Both set to True? See also #2377.\r\n3. Should the package depend on 'mpi'? From one hand, we should run the MPI wrapper. From another hand, netcdf itself does not need mpi and `self.spec['mpi'].mpicc` is set for hdf5/pnetcdf anyway and we can use it.",
