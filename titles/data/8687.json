    "body": "This is my proposed solution for #8670 . It solved my problem where I use a GCC not installed in `/usr` for example, with `extra_rpaths` set to point to that GCC's libraries. Then when I build OpenMPI > 1.10.x using `fabrics=verbs`, which uses `--with-verbs` during OpenMPI configure, it finds the infiniband drivers in `/usr/lib64` so then it adds `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,/usr/lib64` to the OpenMPI wrappers. So then when I use the OpenMPI module to build other random software outside of Spack, the wrappers rpath `/usr/lib64` into the executable which then has GLIBC, GLIBCXX runtime errors due to it picking up libraries in `/usr/lib64` which is the system GCC, rather than my GCC I'm _actually_ using which is installed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTherefore this pull request adds in the directories from `compilers.yaml` `extra_rpaths` into the OpenMPI wrappers using rpath as well. After testing it, it solves the problem I was having with OpenMPI 3.1.0 for example when creating executables with its wrappers.",
