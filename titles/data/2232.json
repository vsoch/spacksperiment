    "body": "I came across this error first, when trying to build a custom made spack package for one of our own modules. There it occurred once I added \r\n```\r\ndepends_on('py-numpy')\r\ndepends_on('py-scipy')\r\n```\r\nto the package.py file. So running ```spack install py-sbs``` completed without these two lines, but obviously it failed at runtime. So I did a ```spack uninstall py-sbs```, added the two lines to the package.py and did a ```spack install py-sbs```\r\nThis then failed with a python traceback like the one below. After doing a ```spack clean py-sbs```, ```spack purge -a``` and a ```spack reindex```, the install went through.\r\n\r\nNow I'm seeing the error message below when trying to install ```py-matplotlib```. I'm not entirely sure how I \"fixed\" it for our own package. Can you provide me with any hints of where this originates at? I haven't touched py-matplotlib's package.py.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[hd_wv385@uc1n996 git]$ spack load --dependencies python@2.7.12%gcc@4.9.3\r\n[hd_wv385@uc1n996 git]$ spack install py-matplotlib\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/bin/spack\", line 203, in <module>\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/bin/spack\", line 180, in main\r\n    return_val = command(parser, args)\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/cmd/install.py\", line 313, in install\r\n    specs = spack.cmd.parse_specs(args.package, concretize=True)\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/cmd/__init__.py\", line 108, in parse_specs\r\n    spec.concretize()  # implies normalize\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/spec.py\", line 1330, in concretize\r\n    self._expand_virtual_packages(),\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/spec.py\", line 1247, in _expand_virtual_packages\r\n    spec)\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/concretize.py\", line 122, in choose_virtual_or_external\r\n    candidates = self._valid_virtuals_and_externals(spec)\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/concretize.py\", line 62, in _valid_virtuals_and_externals\r\n    providers = spack.repo.providers_for(spec)\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/repository.py\", line 75, in converter\r\n    return function(self, spec_like, *args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/repository.py\", line 240, in providers_for\r\n    providers = self.provider_index.providers_for(vpkg_spec)\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/repository.py\", line 234, in provider_index\r\n    self._provider_index.merge(repo.provider_index)\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/repository.py\", line 645, in provider_index\r\n    self._update_provider_index()\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/repository.py\", line 639, in _update_provider_index\r\n    self._provider_index.to_yaml(new)\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/llnl/util/lock.py\", line 312, in __exit__\r\n    if self._as.__exit__(type, value, traceback):\r\n  File \"/pfs/data2/home/hd/hd_hd/hd_wv385/git/spack/lib/spack/spack/file_cache.py\", line 152, in __exit__\r\n    raise value\r\nAttributeError\r\n```",
