Since `mirror create` does not set up the appropriate environment, variables like `spack_cc` are not set.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces `fetch` and `clean` methods for patches. They are no-ops for `FilePatch` but perform the appropriate actions for `UrlPatch`. This allows `mirror create` to invoke `do_fetch`, which does not call the package's `patch` method.",
