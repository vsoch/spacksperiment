The interface has been designed to be\nas simple and intuitive as possible. It supports plotting and reading\npixels in the RGB (red, green, blue), HSV (hue, saturation,\nvalue/brightness) and CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) colour\nspaces, basic shapes, scaling, bilinear interpolation, full TrueType\nantialiased and rotated text support, bezier curves, opening existing\nPNG images and more.\n```\n\nPNGwriter is a dependency for [PIConGPU](http://picongpu.hzdr.de), an open-source, many-core, fully-relativistic particle-in-cell code and further software developed at [Helmholz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf](https://www.hzdr.de).\n### Dependency Graph\n\n``` bash\n$ spack graph pngwriter\no  pngwriter\n|\\\n| |\\\n| | |\\\n| | o |  freetype\n| |/ /\n| o |  libpng\n|/ /\no |  zlib\n /\no  cmake\n\n$ spack graph --concretize pngwriter\no  pngwriter\n|\\\n| |\\\n| | |\\\n| | | o  cmake\n| | | |\\\n| | | o |  openssl\n| |_|/ /\n|/| | | \n| | o |  freetype\n| |/ /\n| o |  libpng\n|/ /\no |  zlib\n /\no  ncurses\n```\n",
