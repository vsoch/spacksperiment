    "body": "This features adds the \"--first\" option for \"spack load\" which circumvents the error condition when multiple packages match the requested spec.  Instead, it just loads the first matching package.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this feature is the situation where spack is being used in an automated workflow (like CI) where we would like to install and load dependencies for a build outside of spack.  In this case, we need (e.g.) cmake@3.16.2, but we don't care about the details beyond that.  When multiple specs match, there is an error that breaks the whole build.  Instead, just load one!\r\n\r\nThis feature was discussed with @luszczek .",
