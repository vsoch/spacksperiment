The newest one is 3.49.  The error solved when I set 3.181 to 3.40\r\n\r\n2.   depends_on('hdf5', when='+hdf5') should be replaced with \"depends_on('hdf5+hl', when='+hdf5')\"\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the cmake should report the error listed as follows. \r\n\r\n```\r\n1 error found in build log:\r\n     122    -- PYTHON3_EXECUTABLE ......... = /mnt/storage-ssd/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-9.3.0/python-3.8.7-awhlsatyaqicmjmu6ldgqsvq\r\n            rbhgkylu/bin/python3.8\r\n     123    -- PYTHON3_LIBRARIES .......... = /mnt/storage-ssd/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-9.3.0/python-3.8.7-awhlsatyaqicmjmu6ldgqsvq\r\n            rbhgkylu/lib/libpython3.8.so\r\n     124    -- PYTHON3_NUMPY_INCLUDE_DIRS . = /mnt/storage-ssd/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-9.3.0/py-numpy-1.19.5-hkt7m4dpowmk7g3yjm73y\r\n            oqbqvitwpmy/lib/python3.8/site-packages/numpy/core/include\r\n     125    -- PYTHON3_Boost_LIBRARIES .... = Boost::python\r\n     126    -- PYTHON3_Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS . = /mnt/storage-ssd/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-9.3.0/boost-1.75.0-2pt2zb4qrm6fy2gprsu32j3o\r\n            523gjxnl/include\r\n     127    -- Configuring done\r\n  >> 128    CMake Error: The following variables are used in this project, but they are set to NOTFOUND.\r\n     129    Please set them or make sure they are set and tested correctly in the CMake files:\r\n     130    HDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY_DEBUG (ADVANCED)\r\n     131        linked by target \"casa_casa\" in directory /tmp/spack/spack-stage/spack-stage-casacore-3.3.0-ybi2lobague5v2bpwdoouptfbnktrmhl/spack-\r\n            src/casa\r\n     132    HDF5_hdf5_hl_LIBRARY_RELEASE (ADVANCED)\r\n     133        linked by target \"casa_casa\" in directory /tmp/spack/spack-stage/spack-stage-casacore-3.3.0-ybi2lobague5v2bpwdoouptfbnktrmhl/spack-\r\n            src/casa\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install casacore@3.3.0%gcc@9.3.0 fftw=True hdf5=True openmp=True python=True target=x86_64\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-1029-0d521d5\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-cascadelake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
