    "body": "Hey there, I'm starting to try to use spack for all of the projects that I build from source, and I was wondering if there is a way to add mingw as a Spack compiler so that I can cross compile windows executables with it. I tried to add mingw to the compilers.yaml file, but it kept failing with an empty error message as soon as I set the `spec` of the compiler to have `mingw` in the name ( even if that was the only thing I changed from the `clang` compiler entry. Does spec do some sort of whitelisting on the compiler names?\r\n\r\nMaybe that is somewhat unrealistic because many projects have to specifically support mingw to allow cross compiling?",
