I'm open to any better ways to package this thing.\r\n\r\nI basically filter all the makefile options that exist to be exactly what I want, using variants where necessary, then remove all the references to `/usr` and `/opt` it searches for libraries in by default, and then I insert lines into the makefile that point the include and library locations to the Spack built libraries. Then I manually install the binary.",
