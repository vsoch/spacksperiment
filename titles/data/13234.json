Further invocations will then read the backup file, effectively reverting prior invocations.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced easily by trying to install likwid, which will try to install into /usr/local. Work around this by creating a temporary file to read from.\r\n\r\n@alalazo @tgamblin @tkameyama",
