This causes problems because the local spack instance might not know about a repo used by the other spack instance.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we will assume all externals are built with the repos that we know about (as we would for externals not built with Spack).\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug reported on Spack slack.",
