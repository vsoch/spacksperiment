    "body": "Note: This exposes a compatibility issue with `py-ipython` which depends on `py-backports-shutil-get-terminal-size` which depends (as build dependency only) on `py-setuptools:30.99.99`. \r\n\r\nCurrently it is not possible to concretize a spec that has conflicting build and run dependencies. All other packages (in all of spack) depend on `py-setuptools@x.y:` so I'm not sure if that adds to much pressure on a concretizer that is able to handle such cases, but for our meta-package it results in a broken `py-flake8` build and after this is merged will result in a failure to concretize.\r\n\r\nIs there an estimate on when the new concretizer will be implemented? @scheibelp @tgamblin @adamjstewart ",
