The build then aborts.\n\n@tgamblin suggested that \"This looks like an issue with tarball caching, which was recently merged.  Spack now keeps the tarballs you download in a local mirror so that if you build 5 variants of one thing you don't have to download 5 times.\"\n\nReverting to an earlier version of Spack -- before archiving was merged -- provided a work-around for me.\n",
