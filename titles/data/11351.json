    "body": "Depends on #11347 for a Ninja with Fortran support, although I don't really know how to make the version dependency robust enough to guarantee it has Fortran support. A `ninja-fortran` package exists, but it probably makes sense to consolidate it into `ninja` as in #11347 . I've been wanting to get Ninja as a generator into Trilinos for a while and now it appears I don't need to do it with this anymore which was stopping me previously (along with the lack of official Fortran support):\r\n```\r\n@property\r\n    def generator(self):\r\n        if '+ninja' in self.spec:\r\n            return 'Ninja'\r\n        else:\r\n            return 'Unix Makefiles'\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: I think https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/pull/1521 means the Kitware Fortran features are finally merged into Ninja itself?",
