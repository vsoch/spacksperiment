    "body": "I recently have been getting into spack and have needed to add packages. In one case I am (trying) to package up [FLAP](https://github.com/szaghi/FLAP) and thought, as a first go I'd use the author's own description from `README.md`:\r\n```\r\nFLAP, Fortran command Line Arguments Parser for poor people\r\n\r\nA KISS pure Fortran Library for building powerful, easy-to-use, elegant command line interfaces\r\n\r\n* FLAP is a pure Fortran (KISS) library for building easily nice Command Line Interfaces (CLI) for modern Fortran projects;\r\n* FLAP is Fortran 2003+ standard compliant;\r\n* FLAP is OOP designed;\r\n* FLAP is a Free, Open Source Project.\r\n```\r\nas that for the package. I added it to the triple-quote but, when you do a `spack info flap`:\r\n```\r\nDescription:\r\n     FLAP, Fortran command Line Arguments Parser for poor people A KISS pure\r\n    Fortran Library for building powerful, easy-to-use, elegant command line\r\n    interfaces * FLAP is a pure Fortran (KISS) library for building easily\r\n    nice Command Line Interfaces (CLI) for modern Fortran projects; * FLAP\r\n    is Fortran 2003+ standard compliant; * FLAP is OOP designed; * FLAP is a\r\n    Free, Open Source Project.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDespite that description being a python triple-quote string, the newlines seem to be stripped out. I did try adding explicit `\\n` characters, but no go.\r\n\r\nThus my request is if it would be possible to allow multiline descriptions.",
