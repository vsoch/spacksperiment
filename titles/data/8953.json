    "body": "Add a package for the fasta sequence alignment tools.\r\n\r\nThe build system is novel (fasta is \"venerable\", so...).  The source tree includes nearly 50 variant Makefiles, the installer is expected to pick one that's appropriate and then edit the \"XDIR\" variable to specify the installation path.  I can only test 64 bit darwin and linux, so that's all I've included.  I'm also assuming that every 64bit x86 system we'll see supports the SSE2 extensions.  Other situations can be dealt with when someone has a test case.\r\n\r\nI looked at using MakefilePackage but I didn't see how to specify the name of the Makefile that it used so this seemed cleaner.\r\n\r\nTested on a RHEL7 linux box and a High Sierra Mac by running the author's suggested test case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfasta36 -q seq/mgstm1.aa seq/prot_test.lseg\r\n```\r\n",
