    "body": "The goal of this work is to make stage.source_path available before it exists.  The approach (per @tgamblin) is to use a well-known stage source path name that is available when Stage is instantiated but does not exist until \"expanded\".  \r\n\r\nWell-behaved tarballs will be expanded such that the stage.source_path is the root directory (so hidden Mac OS X files are in the parent of stage.source_path).  Exploding tarballs will be expanded in their respective subdirectories of stage.source_path.  Un-expanded archives and other files (e.g., patches) will be moved to within stage.source_path.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes assorted documentation updates.",
