It was possible to in kokkos e.g. \"+serial~openmp\" and with kokkos spackage checking for 'serial' and not '+serial', and thus backend would be listed in spack spec but not passed to kokkos configuration. If kokkos is built without a backend choice, it defaults to pthreads - which may be undesirable.",
