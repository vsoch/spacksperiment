    "body": "If I want to run CI for a project that is spack-buildable, and I don't want to host my own binary cache, a useful strategy seems to be to create a base docker image in which you run `spack install --only=dependencies [package name]@develop`, store that image on Dockerhub, and run `spack dev-build --ignore-dependencies [package name]@develop` as part of CI.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the base image becomes very big, so it's natural to mimic `spack containerize` where the binaries are stripped and `spack gc` is called.\r\n\r\nThe problem however is that `spack gc` will uninstall almost everything, since `spack install --only=dependencies ...` never explicitly installed a package.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt would be great if `spack install --only=dependencies` marked the first-level dependencies as explicitly installed, such that `spack gc` will retain those packages. This enables me to reduce the size of the base images with dependencies quite a bit.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
