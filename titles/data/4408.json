Convert it to ~a SpackError~ an InstallError  and call `.format(...)` on the error string to fill in the placeholder.\r\n\r\n- Pull swig out of the list of languages.  It's something that can be asked for explicitly and that is needed if *any* of the langagues are enabled.  It's disabled by default.\r\n\r\n- Explicitly disable the languages that are in \"untested_bindings\" list lest the configure script pick up things from the system.",
