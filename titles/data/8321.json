The intended behaviour got broken during refactoring in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/4300 . This commit fixes the issue by supporting different directories.\r\n\r\np.s. strangely enough, by the time I was reviewing https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/4300 ( the last comment of mine was \"merge it!\"), I completely forgot about the intention of `intel-mpi` and have not tested it at that time...",
