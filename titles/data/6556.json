    "body": "Spack sets `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`. Unfortunately, it's not always enough to make sure that the version of the library from spec is used. Usually, this happens because many cmake scripts search for a list of filenames in a list of paths and the priority is given to the names, i.e. if the first name in the list was not found in `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, cmake will continue to look for that name in the system directories. For example, `FindPythonInterp.cmake` fails to locate Python3 that is installed with Spack because there is no `python` symlink to the executable in the `<prefix>/bin` directory. Another example is `FindBoost.cmake`, which uses a list of version-dependent filenames, and if the version in the spec is older than the version in the system directories, the latter will be used.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to add a method to `PackageBase`, which would provide a dependent `CMakePackage` with flags that would help cmake to pick the right version of the library.",
