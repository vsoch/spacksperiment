This is an attempt to address that while preserving the responsive behavior of input on standard input.\r\n\r\nSummary of changes:\r\n* When reading from in_pipe read as much as possible (polling with select to determine whether more is available) up to 100 lines before re-entering the blocking select, avoiding having to repeatedly set up and tear down signal handlers and so-forth\r\n* Only scan the input line once in the common case, using subn to avoid the findall (which should be changed to either using a function on the sub, or just using \"in\" or similar since we don't care how many just which, leaving that for later since it's a small perf difference)\r\n* Always flush, but flush *after* writing all input that got read in this block rather than on every line",
