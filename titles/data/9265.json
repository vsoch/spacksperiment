    "body": "This commit fixes the absolute path of Apple's `libunwind` library. The current version of the apple-libunwind package will link successfully if the libunwind linking flags are passed using `-L/usr/lib/system -lunwind`, but fail if passed as `/usr/lib/system/libunwind.dylib` with an error `cannot link directly with /usr/lib/system/libunwind.dylib`. The linker will suggest linking with `System.framework` instead; the path used in this commit is equivalent to linking with `System.framework`.  This linker error came up in a project that used CMake and attempted to pass an absolute path to libunwind to the system linker.",
