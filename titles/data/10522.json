I depends on being able to reconstructing the rpath from the spec stored with the buildcache. If this is possible, then the buildcache could be created with binaries that have the rpaths removed. Upon installation the reconstructed rpath would be added to the binaries. \r\n\r\n@tgamblin  do you think reconstructing the rpaths is possible?",
