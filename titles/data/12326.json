The latter is preferred by Spack, even though the first entry in `$PATH` points to the correct location.\r\n\r\nReading through the code, [here](https://github.com/spack/spack/compare/develop...matz-e:compiler-finding?expand=1#diff-2704f79904cd8e67b76094c779924b79L599) we only take the first element, and don't override it later on. Dropping the `reversed` restores the priority as given in `$PATH`, which I think was the orginal intend?",
