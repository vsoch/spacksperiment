This will build the entire GCC system and ensure that it compiles itself correctly. It can be disabled with the --disable-bootstrap parameter to \u2018configure\u2019, but bootstrapping is suggested because the compiler will be tested more completely and could also have better performance.\r\n\r\nAlthough bootstrapping is _suggested_, I found that disabling it changed the build time from 2 hrs to 30 min.",
