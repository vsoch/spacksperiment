This file also declares a view. This used to work fine, but gives an error today after a `git pull`.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --env-dir utils/spack/redshift concretize --force\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output. If there was no error message and no output but the result is incorrect, describe how it does not match what you expect. -->\r\n\r\nThe concretization itself seems to work fine. A `spack.lock` file is created. Then there is this error:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/eschnett/src/CarpetX/spack/bin/spack\", line 76, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(spack.main.main())\r\n  File \"/Users/eschnett/src/CarpetX/spack/lib/spack/spack/main.py\", line 774, in main\r\n    return _invoke_command(command, parser, args, unknown)\r\n  File \"/Users/eschnett/src/CarpetX/spack/lib/spack/spack/main.py\", line 498, in _invoke_command\r\n    return_val = command(parser, args)\r\n  File \"/Users/eschnett/src/CarpetX/spack/lib/spack/spack/cmd/concretize.py\", line 38, in concretize\r\n    env.write()\r\n  File \"/Users/eschnett/src/CarpetX/spack/lib/spack/spack/environment.py\", line 1878, in write\r\n    self.regenerate_views()\r\n  File \"/Users/eschnett/src/CarpetX/spack/lib/spack/spack/environment.py\", line 1335, in regenerate_views\r\n    view.regenerate(specs, self.roots())\r\n  File \"/Users/eschnett/src/CarpetX/spack/lib/spack/spack/environment.py\", line 616, in regenerate\r\n    old_root = self._current_root\r\n  File \"/Users/eschnett/src/CarpetX/spack/lib/spack/spack/environment.py\", line 502, in _current_root\r\n    root = os.readlink(self.root)\r\nOSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument: '/Users/eschnett/src/CarpetX/Cactus/view'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n```\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2651-fc392d2f56\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-bigsur-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue.
