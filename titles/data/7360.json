It would certainly make the openfoam-com package look smaller, and might even be useful to someone else.\r\n\r\nThoughts @alalazo or @tgamblin ?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n/mark\r\n\r\n[openfoam]: https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/openfoam-com/package.py\r\n[L100]: https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/openfoam-com/package.py#L101\r\n[L205]: https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/openfoam-com/package.py#L205",
