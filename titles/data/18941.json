Unfortunately `install -n` is already taken. \r\n\r\nThis would just cut down the number of keystrokes needed to install and make for a better user experience. \r\n\r\nAllowing flags after the spec, like `spack install <spec> -n` would also help here, but that may be a different issue, and probably trickier, as `-` is still used for variants.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nCurrent as of:\r\n```\r\n~/spack (develop)$ spack --version\r\n0.15.4-1137-6ec3c4d\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n",
