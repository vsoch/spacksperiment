    "body": "Add a `spack external find` command which searches through `$PATH` and tries to create a `packages.yaml` of external packages. This focuses on finding build dependencies (currently only `cmake`).\r\n\r\nTo make a package discoverable with `spack external find` the package must define an `.executables` class attribute: a collection of executable names. If Spack finds these executables, it will create a `packages` config entry for them. If the package also defines `.determine_spec_details`, the executables will be passed to that function, which can generate a more-specific `packages.yaml` entry (including version, variants or whatever else the user decides to determine).\r\n\r\nThis currently outputs the relevant yaml configuration to the terminal and doesn't have an option to generate a `packages.yaml` file.\r\n\r\nCloses #2507\r\nFixes #13198\r\nFixes #2116",
