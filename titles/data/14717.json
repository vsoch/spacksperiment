    "body": "`spack arch` currently has a `--known-targets` flag that prints a list of targets it is capable of detecting. I would like to add `--known-platforms` and `--known-operating-systems` flags that do the same thing.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nOftentimes, when writing a package, you need to add conflicts for all platforms/OSes other than a certain one. For example, `py-matplotlib backend=macosx` only works on `darwin`, so the package contains:\r\n```python\r\n    msg = 'MacOSX backend requires the Cocoa headers included with XCode'       \r\n    conflicts('platform=linux', when='backend=macosx', msg=msg)                 \r\n    conflicts('platform=bgq',   when='backend=macosx', msg=msg)                 \r\n    conflicts('platform=cray',  when='backend=macosx', msg=msg) \r\n```\r\nHowever, I have no way of knowing if this is all the platforms that Spack knows of. Until we have a way of expressing \"not\" in the spec syntax, we should at least be able to list all platforms/OSes Spack is aware of.",
