According to the internet, the inline semantics in newer versions of gcc are causing this problem.  I have not tried libiconv 1.15 and do not know if this is an issue with that version as well.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\nspack install libiconv@1.14%gcc@5.3.0\r\nspack install libiconv@1.14%gcc@6.2.0\r\n```",
