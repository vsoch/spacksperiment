    "body": "This PR fixes the `version_argument` field for clang compilers and removes a redundant method in the Clang class that shadows the Compiler class.\r\n\r\nClang previously used GCCs `-dumpversion` argument, which returns `4.2.1` because that was the version of GCC that clang originally targeted for compatibility. Clang's version argument is `--version`.\r\n\r\nThis was obfuscated in the past by clang having its own version of all methods to get version info. #12989 made this problem apparent by using the `version_argument` flag in a method used by clang.",
