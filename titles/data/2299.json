    "body": "I'm not sure how the old recipe worked for anyone. The Lua Makefiles set `CC=gcc` and, at least for my spack environment, the first `gcc` found in the `PATH` is `$SPACK_ROOT/lib/spack/env/gcc`, which is a directory. This caused the build to fail. It should be noted that this change drops the `-std=gnu99`, but this option doesn't appear to be required for a successful build.",
