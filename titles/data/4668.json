    "body": "Hi spack-team,\r\n\r\nI would like to add a [`cling` package](https://github.com/root-project/cling) (also building a jupyter kernel) for CERN's C++ interpreter.\r\nIt looks like cling is usually based on a slightly older version of `llvm` which [also needs certain patches applied](https://root.cern.ch/cling-build-instructions). Should we add a new package for it instead of adding it to `llvm`?\r\n\r\nIn this mode, it also creates a matching `clang` if we want to. How to handle that? (`provides`?)\r\n\r\nDo we have some way to register/handle jupyter kernels already?\r\n\r\nLast but not least: in principle, the already existing `root` package can also create a cling executable (source: [homepage](https://root.cern.ch/cling-build-instructions)). I never tried this. Anyway, in the projects I am interested in, I just want `cling` & `clang` (and a jupyter kernel) and not the whole `ROOT` ecosystem with all its dependencies.",
