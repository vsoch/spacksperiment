This is a WIP at the moment since I haven't thought all the changes through, but I can replicate #5565 and this appears to resolve it.\r\n\r\n* Don't set patches on packages if they have been concretized\r\n* Don't invoke `_concretize_helper` on already-concretized packages (which can add variants for example) - this may not strictly be an issue in #5565 but came up in my debugging. EDIT: this likely shares some logic with https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/4939\r\n* Don't add new dependencies to already-concretized specs: this was the trickiest part since the concretization deconstructs the DAG on each pass, I want to think over my approach here",
