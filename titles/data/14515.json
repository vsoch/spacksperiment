    "body": "*Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nI am trying to install and use Spack on a CentOS 7 machines. I followed the instructions listed on the webpage to get started and ran into issues. I have used Spack on other machines and never run into this. I wonder if there is a missing dependence on this machine, but I am not getting useful debugging info.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nThe first two command complete cleanly, but the third (and any other spack install <package> I have tried), results in an error. The error is the same in every case.\r\n\r\n```console\r\ngit clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git\r\n. spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh\r\nspack install hdf5\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n```console\r\n==> Error: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'version'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n 1. CentOS 7\r\n 2. Minimal configuration (new server)\r\n 3. Python 2.7.5\r\n\r\nI suspect this is something simple, but I have not been able to pin it down. I tried this on another machine just to see if I could reproduce it and I could not. I suspect it is something lacking in the default configuration. Spack is often very good about that and gives very straight-forward error messages. For example, recently it told me that I needed to install patch.",
