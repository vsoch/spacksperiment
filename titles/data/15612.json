Also, recent versions of `pytest` do not depend on `setuptools` (see pytest-dev/pytest#5063).  We're just stuck with an old version of `pytest` because we still support Python 2.6.\r\n\r\nAstute readers may note that `jinja2` also uses `pkg_resources`, but we don't use any parts of it that actually import `pkg_resources`.  So we do not need to remove these imports from `jinja2`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove the parts of `pytest` that need setuptools\r\n",
