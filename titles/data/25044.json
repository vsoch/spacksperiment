    "body": "This PR adds two patches for use when building intel-tbb%nvhpc, as per #25043\r\n\r\nOne should remove compiler flags not recognized by nvhpc.  (I have not thoroughly tested as I have --noswitcherror set on my nvhpc compilers, but did not see any warnings in final spack-build-out.txt).  Also note that the  \"-flifetime-dse=1\" flag is supposed to work around a bug in intel-tbb (see https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/49898), so that bug might be present still (but as nvc++ has no equivalent option that I can find, I do not see any way around it).  (And the patch is only applied when using %nvhpc, so should not affect non %nvhpc builds)\r\n\r\nThe second patch (also only applied for %nvhpc) adds the --no_preincludes when nvc++ is being called as a preprocessor (-E option); this should prevent the pre-included headers from messing up the production of ld version scripts, etc.",
