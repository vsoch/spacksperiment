The PR is based on the previous PR by [benzwick](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/10240) and the local spack repo of [JaroslavHron](https://github.com/JaroslavHron/spack_repo/tree/master/fenics).\r\n\r\nThe changes comprise the 4 python packages,\r\n\r\n- FFC: py-fenics-ffc,\r\n- UFL: py-fenics-ufl,\r\n- FIAT: py-fenics-fiat,\r\n- Dijitso: py-fenics-dijitso,\r\n\r\nand the main Dolfin package,\r\n\r\n- fenics2019.\r\n\r\nThe dolfin package builds and installs the c++ as well as the python interface of FEniCS. To fix an compilation error with the latest boost package a patch file is provided.",
