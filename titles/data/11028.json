    "body": "* Newer versions of IBM XL no longer define `__xlC__`, but define `__ibmxl__` instead.  This one-line patch fixes this problem in Random123.\r\n* This patch was also provided to the Random123 maintiners (Random123@DEShawResearch.com). I don't expect a new release from them for a while, so I believe that this patch is the correct path forward (for now).\r\n* I have chosen to always patch the source code, even when the spack compiler is not _xlc_.  This choice was made because Random123 is a header-only package that is frequently installed using a _Core_ or system default compiler (e.g. `/usr/bin/gcc`) even when the files will be consumed through include directives when other compilers are used (like _xlc_)",
