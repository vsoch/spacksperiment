    "body": "The changes in this pull request make the following improvements to the `metis` package:\n1. Fix a bug that was causing the tests for `metis@5:` installs to fail on some systems .\n2. Update the patching strategies for the `metis` and `parmetis` packages so that they can take advantage of Spack's patch skipping capabilities (previously these packages would fail when re-patching due to  build environment complications).\n3. Clean up line break and style problems introduced during the automated Spack SQA update.\n\nI'm not really satisfied with the solution I implemented for change 1, but it should be sufficient for the time being.  If anyone can think of a cleaner implementation, please let me know and I'll put it into this PR.  Also, please let me know if there are any other changes that I should update!\n",
