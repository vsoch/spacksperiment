That's what it looks like to me after coming back to Spack after several weeks, but I want to make sure that's the case.\r\n\r\nAlso, I might already have suggested to use a larger version number do indicate that's it different from the most recent release, e.g.\r\n```sh\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.10.0.9000\r\n```\r\nfor develop branch(es).  As long as that 'extra' in x.y.z-extra is there, I am happy; I don't really need it to increase for every single commit / push as long as it's a very clear indicator that I'm running something different that stable release and that can pass a version comparison `x.y.z < x.y.z.extra < x.y.z+1`.  (The `.9000` suffix has become a de-facto standard in the R community.)\r\n",
