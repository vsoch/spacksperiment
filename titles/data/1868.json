    "body": "`py-pil` does not currently build with Python3.  This PR encodes that fact into the `py-pil` package, turning a build error into a an error during the `spack spec` phase.\n\n`py-pil` and `py-pillow` both implement the `pil` virtual package.  If one is using Python3 (for example, one specified `python@3:` in `packages.yaml`), then Spack should figure out that `py-pil` is not going to work and use `py-pillow` instead.  It does not do that.  Instead, it gives an error message during `spack spec`.  I consider this a bug, but not high priority:\n\n```\n$ spack spec py-basemap\n==> Error: Invalid spec: 'python@3.5.2%gcc@5.3.0~tk~ucs4 arch=linux-SuSE11-x86_64'. Package python requires version :2.8, but spec asked for 3.5.2\n```\n\nStepping back... why do we include `py-pil` in the Spack repo anyway?  `py-pillow` seems to be more current, and I can't see any reason to prever `py-pil` over it.  Can we at least set `py-pillow` to be the default `pil` provider?\n",
