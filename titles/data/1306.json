No cmake version is specified explicitly, although some package specify cmake version constraints.\n\nSpack decides to install `cmake @3.4.3`. This version number does not appear anywhere. However, it is the version number given in cmake's `url` string.\n\nThis looks like a bug. Spack should choose the most modern cmake version here, which is `cmake @3.6.0`.\n",
