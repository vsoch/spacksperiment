    "body": "`sbang` was previously a bash script but did not need to be. This converts it to a plain old POSIX shell script and adds some options. This also allows us to simplify sbang shebangs to `#!/bin/sh /path/to/sbang` instead of `#!/bin/bash /path/to/sbang`.\r\n\r\nThe new script passes shellcheck (with a few exceptions noted in the file)\r\n\r\n- [x] `SBANG_DEBUG` env var enables printing what *would* be executed\r\n- [x] `sbang` checks whether it has been passed an option and fails gracefully\r\n- [x] `sbang` will now fail if it can't find a second shebang line, or if\r\n      the second line happens to be sbang (avoid infinite loops)\r\n- [x] add more rigorous tests for `sbang` behavior using `SBANG_DEBUG`",
