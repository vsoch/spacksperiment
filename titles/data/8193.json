Module-related info:\r\n```console\r\n$ type module\r\nmodule is a function\r\nmodule () \r\n{ \r\n    if [[ $1 == \"purge\" ]]; then\r\n        echo \"\";\r\n        echo \"BEWARE: Running \\\"module purge\\\" puts your environment in an unreliable state.\";\r\n        echo \"Doing so makes it difficult to debug problems or for support staff to help\";\r\n        echo \"you.

If there are two ways to locate `modulecmd`, why print a warning message unless both fail?\r\n2. Why are we looking for `modulecmd` multiple times instead of saving the result of the first search?\r\n3. Why do simple commands like `spack help` or `spack arch` also print these warnings? Are we always searching for `modulecmd`? Seems like a great way to slow Spack down to a grinding halt.\r\n\r\n@mamelara @becker33 @tgamblin ",
