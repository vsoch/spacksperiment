    "body": "Avoid reinstallation of packages for environment only changes\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nSpack will install a separate build of a package for each variant combination.  For packages built from source, that makes sense.  However, for binary packages, especially large binary packages, this can be very wasteful.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the `nvhpc` packages provides `mpi`, `blas`, and `lapack` variants to enable / disable specific functionality.  These are essentially just environment differences, yet each variant combination will reinstall the otherwise identical package.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAn initial thought is a new variant attribute to indicate that it is an environment change only and does not require a package reinstall, e.g.,\r\n\r\n`variant('mpi', default=False, env_only=True)`\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOn a related note, binary packages often do not have instruction set or Linux distribution level differences either.  The ability to specify that, e.g.,`linux-centos8-haswell` or `linux-ubuntu18.04-skylake_avx512` can use the same package installation, but `linux-rhel8-power9le` is different, would also prevent unnecessary duplicate installations.",
