Should note I\u2019ve been able to successfully install this in the past and trying with a Spack revision from a few months ago worked as expected. Looking at the dependencies the only change was a newer version of `zeromq` and I wasn't able to find a specific change to autotools that would seem like I could attribute to this new error?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/lib/spack/spack/build_systems/autotools.py#L188\r\n\r\nSo adding the `def autoreconf` to execute the `autogen.sh` seemed like the solution in this case but I'm not an expert on this package so there may exist a better solution.",
