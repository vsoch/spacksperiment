    "body": "I want a Spack Docker container based on Ubuntu 20.04. I refer to the image that is used by Spack to build packages (the \"build\" stage).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nUbuntu 18.04 provides GCC 7, which is too old. I need at least GCC 8. By using Ubuntu 20.04 as base image, this would be solved.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt is possible to install GCC 8 with Ubuntu 18.04, and change a few settings to make it the default compiler. However, this would also need to be done in the base image that Spack uses to build, and might be more difficult than switching to Ubuntu 20.04.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to build a newer GCC with Spack, and use this later to build other packages. This is also a more complex approach.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.15.3-490-80a382c21\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
