    "body": "This attempts to address one of the complaints at https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/5996#issuecomment-339799172:\r\n\r\n> Repo currently caches package instances by Spec, and those Package instances have a Spec. This is unnecessary and causes confusion. I think I thought that we'd need to cache instances after loading package classes, but really just caching the classes is fine.\r\n\r\nWith this update, `Repo`'s package cache is removed and `Specs` cache the package reference themselves. One consequence is that `Specs` which compare as equal will store separate instances of a `Package` class (not doing this creates issues for https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/4595#issuecomment-345117252).\r\n\r\nThere were several references to `Spec.package` that could be replaced with `Spec.package_class` without any additional modifications. There are still a couple remaining references to `Spec.package` in `Spec` that would require adding functionality before replacing (e.g. calling `Package.provides` and `Package.installed`).\r\n\r\nNote this makes it difficult to mock fetchers for tests which invokes code that reconstructs specs. `test_packaging` was one example of this where the updates caused a failure (in that case the error was avoided by not making an unnecessary call).\r\n",
