    "body": "Add an option to the `spack external find` command that displays the currently-configured external packages\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nCurrently the only way to list external packages via Spack is to execute `spack config get packages`. The only other method appears to be to manually parse the `packages.yaml` file, which can be prone to typically human errors.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSince the `external` command already has an internal function `_get_predefined_externals()` that gathers the specs for currently-configured external packages, it should be simple to create an option that calls `spack.cmd.display_specs(...)` with the predefined externals list. I recommend the command `spack external find --in-config` that would list the already-configured externals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nNo additional information\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n  - 0.16.2-2884-b375500\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
