    "body": "Fixes #3593.\r\n\r\nWithout this Makefile patch, I wasn't able to build htop on CentOS 6. I ran into the same bug as reported [here](https://github.com/hishamhm/htop/issues/198).\r\n\r\nI also noticed that even though `htop` depends on `ncurses`, it isn't linking to the Spack `ncurses` installation:\r\n```\r\n$ ldd -r htop \r\n\tlinux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffe38ffb000)\r\n\tlibncursesw.so.5 => /lib64/libncursesw.so.5 (0x00002aec5e5d7000)\r\n\tlibm.so.6 => /lib64/libm.so.6 (0x00002aec5e805000)\r\n\tlibtinfo.so.5 => /lib64/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00002aec5ea89000)\r\n\tlibgcc_s.so.1 => /lib64/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00002aec5ecab000)\r\n\tlibc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00002aec5eec1000)\r\n\tlibdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00002aec5f255000)\r\n\t/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00002aec5e3b5000)\r\n```\r\nMy understanding is that by default ncurses builds a `libncurses.so` library. If you add the `--enable-widec` flag, it instead builds a `libncursesw.so` library. But even though we pass that flag to configure, it doesn't seem to create the \"w\" versions of the library. Does anyone know why that could be the case? I sent a bug report to the ncurses developers.",
