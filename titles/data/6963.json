    "body": "I just ran into the same problem as @simoatze in #6942 and was confused because I have been compiling flex 2.6.4 with GCC 7 for quite some time. Some further debugging shows that newer Ubuntu releases seem to cause the problem and not GCC 7 (tested on Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 17.10 and and Fedora 27). There is probably some other underlying problem but I could not find it (Ubuntu 17.10 and Fedora 27 use the same glibc version, for example).\r\n\r\nBy the way: is it possible to somehow specify `arch=linux-ubuntu17.10-*` or do we only care about `x86_64` anyway?\r\n\r\nEdit: Arch and Gentoo also do not carry any GCC7-specific patches (Fedora and Ubuntu still use older flex versions).",
