    "body": "This PR allows the `list_url` setting in a package file to be used to determine urls for archive file retrieval. This allows for continued retrieval of checksummed archive files even when they are moved to a new remote location when a package is updated upstream.\n\nI fixed the line space flake8 errors but left the line length errors in as I did not want to change formatting too much. This will cause the Travis tests to fail. Let me know if I should fix the rest of the flake8 errors.\n",
