So there\r\nshould not be a need to modify files where no execute bit is set.\r\nThis avoids a problem that I ran into while trying to package our visualization\r\nsoftware COVISE (https://github.com/hlrs-vis/covise), which includes example\r\ndata in Tecplot format: the sbang post-install hook is applied to every\r\ninstalled file that starts with the two characters #!, but this fails on the\r\nbinary Tecplot files, as they happen to start with #!TDV. Decoding them with\r\nUTF-8 fails and an exception is thrown during post_install.",
