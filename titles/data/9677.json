    "body": "It looks like the  `depends_on('python@2.6:2.8,3.3:')` line in the scikit-learn package is inadequate.  \r\n\r\nscikit-learn 19.1 won't build against python 3.7.0 due to an apparent API change.  It reports lots of errors along the lines of:\r\n>sklearn/cluster/_dbscan_inner.cpp:6034:13: error: \u2018PyThreadState\u2019 {aka \u2018struct _ts\u2019} has no member named \u2018exc_traceback\u2019; did you mean \u2018curexc_traceback\u2019?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Python 2.6 and 3.3 aren't supported by the newer versions of scikit-learn.\r\n\r\nI think we're going to need several `depends_on(..., when='...')` lines to sort things out correctly.
