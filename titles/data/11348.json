    "body": "Based on the LLVM documentation [1], Python is used to run the automated\r\ntest suite. Therefore is it always a dependency for LLVM. However, if\r\nbuild without Python (~python), we limit it to a build time dependency.\r\n\r\nNote that py-lit is not added as a spack dependency even though it is\r\navailable as a spack package. This is because it is already included\r\nin llvm and llvm is difficult to configure using an external py-lit\r\n(several CMake variables to set correctly). Additionally, having\r\npy-lit as a spack dependency adds Python as a runtime dependency\r\nfor llvm even though it is not required at runtime.\r\n\r\n[1] https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html#requirements\r\n\r\nReplaces accidentally closed and deleted #10986",
