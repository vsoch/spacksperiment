    "body": "Fixes #2346.\r\n\r\nSome package URLs include a period in their name, such as:\r\n```\r\nhttps://pypi.io/packages/source/b/backports.ssl_match_hostname/backports.ssl_match_hostname-3.5.0.1.tar.gz\r\n```\r\nWhen running `spack create`, this was being interpreted as a package name of `ssl_match_hostname` and a NAMESPACE of `backports`. This PR replaces periods and underscores with dashes, so as to match the rest of Spack. I've never used Spack's NAMESPACE support, so can someone who does test this PR for me?\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants me to, I can rename packages like `the_silver_searcher` and `SAMRAI` to be lowercase and separated by dashes. And then we can get into the debate over `R` vs. `r` :smile: ",
