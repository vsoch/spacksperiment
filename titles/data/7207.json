    "body": "JCHRONOSS is a validation process, designed to scale in HPC environments, to increase time to test result.\r\nThis tool is aware of cluster users & admins, to adapt the workload according to needs, to keep in mind the shortest time between coding and validating step.\r\n\r\nThe software is compliant with batch managers like SLURM or Torque and can produce multiple output format (JSON, JUNIT, YAML,...) that can then be directly uploaded in any reporting platform (like Jenkins). When people can't have a fully-integrated reviewing interface, JCHRONOSS provides a lightweight result viewer, to check results trends without leaving the cluster.\r\n\r\nYou can find Doxygen-based documentation and more information on the website: [http://jchronoss.hpcframework.com](http://jchronoss.hpcframework.com)\r\n\r\nPlease let me know about any issue about this pull-request.\r\nThanks.",
