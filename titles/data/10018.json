    "body": "SAGA is a GIS for Automated Geoscientific Analyses and has been designed for an easy and effective implementation of spatial algorithms.  It offers a comprehensive, growing set of geoscientific methods and provides an easily approachable user interface with many visualisation options. It offers both a cmd (for batch jobs) and a gui mode as well.\r\n\r\nThe most recent dependencies of saga-gis include at-spi2-core, which is built with meson, which requires python3. I added a fixme line because this implicit dependency requires that saga-gis depends on python3 as well, even though there is no need to (since the need for python3 should be limited to the build system meson). Don't know if there is a better solution available...",
