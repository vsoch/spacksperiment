This PR adds a variant which triggers an edit of said file prior to running `make`.\r\n\r\nThis allowed me to run `spack install sys_vimrc_file=/etc/vimrc` which causes the system vimrc file in the vim installation to be set to `/etc/vimrc`, as confirmed by running `:version` inside of `vim` to observe\r\n\r\n`\r\n   system vimrc file: \"/etc/vimrc\"\r\n`\r\n\r\nwhich differs from a vanilla `vim` install in which\r\n\r\n`\r\n   system vimrc file: \"$VIM/vimrc\"\r\n`\r\n\r\nNOTE: I'm not sure this is the best way to connect package variants and header file edits, so if there is a better pattern to accomplish this, please let me know! @becker33 may know a better way.",
