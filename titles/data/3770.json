It is quite urgent for me to use cudnn thus I resubmit a PR with slight modification. \r\n\r\n**LIMITATION**: As the file name `cudnn-8.0-linux-x64-v5.1.tgz` indicates, this package works for `cudnn@5.1` against `cuda@8.0` on x86_64 Linux platform only. Future work can be done to adapt it to more platforms.",
