Up until now it just assumed\nthat one was available on the system.\n\nThis change adds a depends_on('tcl') to the lmod package.\n\nThe tcl package installs a tclsh script with an embedded version\nnumber (e.g. tclsh8.6) but the lmod configuration looks for tclsh.\nThis change extends the tcl package to symlink tclshX.Y to tclsh in\nthe tcl package bin directory.\n\nCloses #1257.\n",
