    "body": "Reverts spack/spack#18574\r\n\r\nI've been using `spack dev-build` in CI to do multistage docker builds. #18574 breaks this setup without providing a convenient alternative.\r\n\r\nMy setup (simplified a bit) looks like this:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM some_base_image AS builder\r\n\r\nWORKDIR /sources\r\n\r\nRUN spack dev-build [spec]\r\n\r\nFROM ubuntu:18.04\r\n\r\nCOPY --from=builder /sources/spack-build /sources/spack-build # <-- this fails now.\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the image is deployed to some cluster, and some MPI tests are run using `ctest`.\r\n\r\nI can't easily rename the `spack-build=[hash]` folder to `spack-build`, since that breaks ctest (it uses absolute paths which won't resolve afterwards). Also I can't do globbing in `COPY --from=builder /sources/spack-build* <dest>`, since I have to specify the destination folder explicitly, and I don't know the hash here.",
