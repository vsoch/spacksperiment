    "body": "Re-phrase now that problem is clear.\r\n\r\n1. I ran out of space during a `spack install --keep-stage llvm`.  I still have the stage, but `spack install` now deletes any existing stages.  So assuming I get enough free space for a `make install`, will `spack reindex` then show that it has `llvm` installed, or do I need to do something else?\r\n\r\n2. LLVM defaults to a debug build.  This is an unacceptable reversion from when there was a `debug` variant.  It likely has ensnared many victims.  It's gotten me twice now.\r\n\r\nblame shows @adamjstewart , [it fell in here](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/commit/07aec4366fa8926ee896fdb2f0c5a68dad3267b5#diff-7110bc5b4f5fce0954915e4a3784329c).  Is there any particular reason you deleted the `debug` variant and also made it Debug by default?\r\n\r\nI still :heart: you, but this one needs to go back right?  The problem now is that if `debug` variant is reintroduced, that's going to orphan anybody who has currently installed `llvm` without that variant (hashes will change).\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\nI assume no, but am hoping I just don't know enough.  I **must** recompile this in order to have the expected sizes right?  There is no way to use the existing (but successful) installation without also wasting over 32GB of space?",
