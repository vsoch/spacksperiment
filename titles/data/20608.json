    "body": "This is a continuation of #18322 \r\n\r\nLately, I've been encountering a lot of issues where libuuid is listed as a transitive dependency and ends up breaking my builds on macOS. The cause is already listed in our `python` package:\r\n\r\n> On macOS systems, Spack's libuuid conflicts with the system-installed version and breaks anything linked against Cocoa/Carbon. Since the system-provided version is sufficient to build Python's UUID support, the easy solution is to only depend on Spack's libuuid when *not* on a Mac.\r\n\r\n#18322 introduced 3 possible virtual providers for `uuid`. I compared the header files from those 3 to the one on macOS, but it didn't match, so I added a new `apple-libuuid` package.\r\n\r\nTested by building `python+uuid` and confirming that `import uuid` works.\r\n\r\nCloses #20385 ",
