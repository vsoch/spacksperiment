I saw this in a couple of formulae.\n\nAs a user, it is also not clear to me what spack compiler wrappers are and why are they here, i.e. in `openmpi`\n\n```\n    def setup_dependent_environment(self, module, spec, dep_spec):\n        \"\"\"For dependencies, make mpicc's use spack wrapper.\"\"\"\n        os.environ['OMPI_CC'] = 'cc'\n        os.environ['OMPI_CXX'] = 'c++'\n        os.environ['OMPI_FC'] = 'f90'\n        os.environ['OMPI_F77'] = 'f77'\n```\n\nI would actually expect something like\n\n```\n    def setup_dependent_environment(self, module, spec, dep_spec):\n        os.environ['MPI_CC'] = 'mpicc'\n        os.environ['MPI_CXX'] = 'mpic++'\n        os.environ['MPI_FC'] = 'mpif90'\n        os.environ['MPI_F77'] = 'mpif77'\n```\n\nand then those will be used throughout in each formula where needed.\n",
