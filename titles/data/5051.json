This works fine.\r\n\r\nNow I would like create new environment (with additional modules) which has say `PrgEnv-intel` and `perftools` module also loaded. (typically for profiling code etc). So I created  `~/.spack/compilers.yaml` as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n compilers.yaml\r\ncompilers:\r\n- compiler:\r\n    environment: {}\r\n    extra_rpaths: []\r\n    flags: {}\r\n    modules:\r\n    - PrgEnv-intel\r\n    - perftools\r\n    - !!python/unicode 'intel/17.0.0.098'\r\n    operating_system: CNL\r\n    paths:\r\n      cc: cc\r\n      cxx: CC\r\n      f77: ftn\r\n      fc: ftn\r\n    spec: intel@18\r\n    target: any\r\n```\r\n\r\nSay `intel@18` is new spec /version. Now I want to use it as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack -d install hdf %intel@18\r\n==> Reading config file /gpfs/mira-home/kumbhar/spack/etc/spack/defaults/packages.yaml\r\n==> Reading config file
