The build is done in two steps:\r\nFirst build the compute node components:\r\n         spack install cbtf-krell%gcc@7.2.0 +runtime+mpich os=CNL\r\nThen build the login node components:\r\n         spack install openspeedshop%gcc@7.2.0 +crayfe+mpich+cbtf os=sles12\r\n\r\nThe login node components depend on the installation paths for several of the compute node components.  This is where these changes depend on a intermediate solution to that problem based on @scheibelp direction.\r\n'''",
