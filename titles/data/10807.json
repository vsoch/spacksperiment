    "body": "@jgalarowicz, my attempts to build openspeedshop in spack failed b/c it was specifying the PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR only up to the python \"include\" path. The actual Python.h file is in the versioned sub directory pythonX.Y, i.e. \"include/python2.7\" for Python 2.7. CMake should be smart enough to figure this out, so in this PR, I remove the specification of the include directory. One could also specify it, but include the versioned sub directory if you feel that's a better solution.",
