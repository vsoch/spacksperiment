    "body": "@hauten \r\n\r\nThe [Spack tutorial](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) is currently hosted as part of the main Spack Documentation at [spack.readthedocs.io](https://spack.readthedocs.io).  Move it to its own site at [spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io) and link to that site from the main documentation.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWe want to be able to version the Spack tutorial separately from Spack.  For example, there should be a version of the Spack tutorial for SC16, SC17, SC18, and SC19.  Some of these are half-day tutorials, some are full day, and some are targeted slightly differently from others.  If someone wants to host a tutorial of their own, they should be able to find the materials that best match their event.\r\n\r\nHowever, the tutorial is currently versioned with Spack releases, and we only really show the latest version of the tutorial [on the tutorial page](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).  People can't easily browse past tutorials -- only past Spack releases.  We also host the slides for the tutorial separately from the tutorial (we put them on spack.io), to avoid adding large files to the mainline Spack repository.  They could just be bundled with the tutorial if it were a separate repo.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Create a new `spack-tutorial` repo in the [spack organization](https://github.com/spack).\r\n- [x] Pull the tutorial out of the main Spack repo but [keep its history intact](https://help.github.com/en/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository), and putit in the new repository. This may be tricky but we can start by just pulling all the docs directory out and work from there.\r\n- [x] Refactor the new repo so that it's just the tutorial.\r\n- [x] Set up a new readthedocs.org instance for `spack-tutorial`\r\n- [x] Get the `spack-tutorial` repo showing up on readthedocs.\r\n- [x] Tag past instances of the tutorial so that they show up as \"versions\" on readthedocs.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nWe may also need to add a new `localized-tutorial` repo to complement [localized-docs](https://github.com/spack/localized-docs), but the tutorial isn't translated yet so we can hold off.",
