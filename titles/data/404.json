Virtual packages could be used in a second time to enforce some properties on the providers.\n\nVirtual packages have to exists in order to by provided. Before a package not present was considered as virtual, with this PR a package not present is an error. \n\nI encountered a problem, it is not possible to install a virtual package `spack install lapack` was resulting in an infinite loop. I added an exception when spack tries to concretize a virtual package, but that is most probably not the best solution.\n",
