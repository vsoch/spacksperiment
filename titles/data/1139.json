    "body": "Great news that the download cache has been merged.  However... I can't find documentation for it!  Key questions need to be addressed include:\n1. How do you turn this feature on/off?\n2. Where is the cache located?\n3. What do tarballs look like in the cache?\n4. Anything else regarding special cases, etc?\n\nHopefully this shouldn't be much.  @scheibelp can you please add docs to the Spack user manual and submit in a new PR?  That will ensure that people are able to make use of all the work that went into this feature.  Thanks!\n",
