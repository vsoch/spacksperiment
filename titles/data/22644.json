This is particularly useful for building spack based containers for a pre-defined application stack.\r\n\r\nAs an example, building a spack based container for adios might use a `Dockerfile` that looks something like this:\r\n```\r\nFROM spack/ubuntu-bionic\r\n\r\nENV SPACK_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3.6\r\n\r\nCOPY adios2-env.yml /root/adios2-env.yml\r\nRUN spack env create adios2 /root/adios2-env.yml && \\\r\n    rm -f /root/adios2-env.yml\r\nSHELL [\"/usr/local/bin/spack-named-env\", \"adios2\", \"/bin/bash\", \"-c\"]\r\n\r\nRUN spack install -v && \\\r\n    spack clean -a\r\n\r\nENTRYPOINT [\"/usr/local/bin/spack-named-env\", \"adios2\"]\r\nCMD [\"/bin/bash\" ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is particularly useful for building CI environments with pre-packaged dependencies where the environment might just contain the target package and the CI image would be built with `spack install --only dependencies`.",
