    "body": "FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. I add a draft pacakge for it. This package has only three variants: `shared`, `pic` and `static`. The real variants in ffmpeg (`configure -h`) is much longer. \r\n\r\nIt has been built successfully against `%gcc@6` and `%intel@2017`. I think it is ready to merge and can be further improved by future RPs.",
