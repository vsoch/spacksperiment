    "body": "@tgamblin I had a nasty failure in #1875 on `TestTcl`, which seems mostly unrelated to the PR. I see that many other PRs are also affected by the same failure. In #1875 I have a fix for that (last commit) that I am not sure if it should be considered a work-around or not.\r\n\r\nMy guess on the failure is that it may be an interaction between two PRs (#2920 is one of the culprits) that were fine taken singularly, but may trigger a failure if merged together. We didn't see this because we don't force a Travis build when we merge PRs that:\r\n1. are in a green state \r\n2. were tested on an old revision of `develop`\r\n3. do not exhibits conflict\r\n\r\nI think we should enforce a PR being tested on the HEAD of `develop` to avoid errors like this in the future. What do you think?",
