Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install qgis\r\n```\r\nresults in several concretization (`^cairo`, `gobject` conflict) and compilation (`^llvm`, `binutils` missing a property) errors, at least on my platform.\r\nI managed to solve the issues by specifying\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install qgis^cairo+gobject^binutils+plugins\r\n```\r\nUnless this is specific to my system, it might be good to update the default behavior (I unfortunately don't know how to set this up, but hope the details help).\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2211-a4d32fd\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.6\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. \r\n* [spack-build-out.txt]()\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt]() -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n@Sinan81  @adamjstewart\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
