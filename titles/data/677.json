I've tested this on Linux (it builds `gcc@5.3.0`, `py-scipy^opebblas`, `py-scipy^netlib-lapack`, and `py-scipy^atlas` fine.  I also tested it with building @eschnett's `gcc@5.3.0` for Mac OS, which I will also merge soon.\n\nI'm about to merge it.\n\n@eschnett: look good to you?\n@gartung: Is `-S` handled correctly here for `gcc@4.9.3` on Mac OS?  I would like to get your fix in if possible.\n",
