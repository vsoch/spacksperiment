    "body": "I recently made a change to the `spack` executable, but `spack flake8` did not detect the change. This PR fixes that.\r\n\r\nAre there any other Python files in Spack that don't end in `.py`? We could check for `python` in the shebang, but that's probably more costly than it needs to be. For what it's worth, `flake8` also only looks at `*.py` files [by default](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/blob/master/src/flake8/main/options.py#L88,L96). We could also use the `file` command on UNIX:\r\n```console\r\n$ file spack\r\nspack: Python script text executable, ASCII text\r\n$ file spack-python \r\nspack-python: POSIX shell script text executable, ASCII text\r\n```",
