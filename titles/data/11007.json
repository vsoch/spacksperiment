    "body": "*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*\r\nSuppose you have package A version 1.0 which ONLY works with package B version 2.0 and everything other version is a conflict. You can also think of this as a \"hard dependency.\"\r\n\r\nPresently to express this conflict you need to do\r\n`conflicts('%packageA@:0.99,1.1:', when='packageB@:1.99,2.1:')`\r\n\r\nThis will achieve the desired result, but expressing conflicts by excluding ranges is error prone and not clear to other developers (at least not initially).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nVersion-to-version specific conflicts would make it easier to maintain CUDA compiler conflicts. See for example conversation:\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/pull/10924\r\n\r\nThere are other examples, for example the QMCPACK converters only work with a single specific version of QE.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nPlease considering implementing version-to-version specific conflicts.\r\n",
