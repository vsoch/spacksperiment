Here we swap this priority and we consider variants that are forced by any means (root spec or spec in depends_on clause) the same as if they were with a default value.\r\n\r\nThis prevents the solver from avoiding expected configurations just because they contain directives like:\r\n```python\r\ndepends_on('pkg+foo')\r\n```\r\nand `+foo` is not the default variant value for pkg.",
