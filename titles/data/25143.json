    "body": "### Description\r\n`mvapich2` vendors its `hwloc` dependency; this causes problems when applications or runtimes depend on both `mpi` and `hwloc`. This can be partially worked around by ensuring that both `hwloc` versions are the same\u2014but whether this works depends on the link order of the application (in particular, it seems that `mvapich2`'s `libmpi.so` must be linked before `libhwloc.so`).\r\n\r\nThe proper solution is to use a non-vendored `hwloc`, similar to current practice in the `openmpi` and `mpich` packages.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-2869-b7a827b82f\r\n* **Python:** 3.9.4\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos8-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\nPinging maintainers @natshineman @harisubramoni @ndcontini",
