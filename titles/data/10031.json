In my case, I commended out all of the specs in my environment, which left a dangling 'spec' key. I was able to write and quit the file without any linting; but when I tried to repoen it, I got an error and a trace.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# spack config edit\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"spack/bin/spack\", line 48, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(spack.main.main())\r\n  File \"spack/lib/spack/spack/main.py\", line 605, in main\r\n    env = ev.find_environment(args)\r\n  File \"spack/lib/spack/spack/environment.py\", line 182, in find_environment\r\n    return Environment(env)\r\n  File \"spack/lib/spack/spack/environment.py\", line 365, in __init__\r\n    self._read_manifest(f)\r\n  File \"spack/lib/spack/spack/environment.py\", line 377, in _read_manifest\r\n    self.yaml = _read_yaml(f)\r\n  File \"spack/lib/spack/spack/environment.py\", line 318, in _read_yaml\r\n    validate(data, filename)\r\n  File \"spack/lib/spack/spack/environment.py\", line 311, in validate\r\n    e, data, filename, e.instance.lc.line + 1)\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lc'\r\n```\r\n\r\nLinting the config immediately after closing is a better idea in my opinion.
