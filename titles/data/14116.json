    "body": "PR #13975 added makefile filtering to replace gcc/g++ with the spack\r\ncompiler. This conflicts with other filtering that is done in the package to\r\nadd paths for dependencies. The text of the dependency paths might\r\nhave 'gcc' in the path name, depending on the install_path_scheme, and\r\nthat was being replaced by the new compiler filters. That would mangle\r\nthe path to the dependecy resulting in a failed build.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the compiler filters to be before the other filters to\r\nmake sure that the compiler is set before the dependency paths.",
