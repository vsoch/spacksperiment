    "body": "If you install packages using `spack install` in an environment with complex spec constraints, and the install fails, you may want to test out the build using `spack build-env`; one issue (particularly if you use `concretize: together`) is that it may be hard to pass the appropriate spec that matches what the environment is attempting to install.\r\n\r\nThis updates the `build-env` command to default to pulling a matching spec from the environment rather than concretizing what the user provides on the command line independently.\r\n\r\nThis makes a similar change to `spack cd`.\r\n\r\nIf the user-provided spec matches multiple specs in the environment, then these commands will now report an error and display all matching specs (to help the user specify).\r\n\r\n@bvanessen I'm wondering if this helps you with your work",
