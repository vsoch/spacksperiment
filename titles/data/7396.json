    "body": "Installing intel-mkl under macOS gives the issue described here: #3730. I had some time to investigate it in detail. This is not an Intel issue. Intel provides different packages for Linux and macOS. Both contain the same ``install.sh``, but the rest of the packages are different. The macOS package is a ``*.dmg`` archive.\r\n\r\nI can not see any way to get it to work under macOS. A workaround is as follows:\r\n1. Download intel-mkl from Intel's homepage\r\n2. Install intel-mkl manually\r\n3. Add the following to your ``~/.spack/packages.yaml``:\r\n```\r\nall:\r\n  intel-mkl:\r\n    paths:\r\n      intel-mkl@2018.1.126 arch=<your-system>: /opt/intel\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
