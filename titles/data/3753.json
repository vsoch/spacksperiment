    "body": "The variant is needed when building ZFP to be used for H5Z-ZFP plugin (see https://github.com/LLNL/H5Z-ZFP)\r\n\r\n- I did not see a way to install all include files in a dir or dir-tree from within spack's install method using the install function. That seems problematic if the package doesn't define an install target yet has numerous (and possibly names changing with releases) header files to install. It'd be nicer to just be able to install **everything** under a specific dir tree.\r\n- it is not clear in the docs whether spec.satisifies[':@0.5.1'] is strictly less than or less than or equal\r\n- I ran into some funkyness with md5sum...I manually downloaded the zfp tarball via Safari and computed an md5 checksum using OSX md5 command. The value I got was not the same that spack computed during its download\r\n",
