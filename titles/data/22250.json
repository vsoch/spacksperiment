    "body": "Currently, the temporary directory of bazel is hardcoded to `/tmp`. If you are building on a system with low disk space on root, this can prevent you from building (and so it did for me). In my opinion, it is cleaner to let `tempfile.mkdtemp` decide on an appropriate file location instead of hardcoding `/tmp`. This allows users to define other partitions that are better fitted for compiling large projects.\r\n\r\nFrom the documentation of `tempfile.mkdtemp` ([link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html#tempfile.mkstemp)):\r\n> If dir is not None, the file will be created in that directory; otherwise, a default directory is used. The default directory is chosen from a platform-dependent list, but **the user of the application can control the directory location by setting the TMPDIR, TEMP or TMP environment variables.** There is thus no guarantee that the generated filename will have any nice properties, such as not requiring quoting when passed to external commands via os.popen().\r\n\r\nRelated to  #20212",
