My package is dependent on bzip2 and libtool, but their installation is failing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nIn config.yaml, change install tree to `install_tree: $padding`\r\n\r\n```console\r\n-bash-4.2$ spack install --no-cache libtool\r\n==> Warning: gcc@4.8.5 cannot build optimized binaries for \"skylake_avx512\".
