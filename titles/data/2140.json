Previously, when I ran `spack install xyz`, if I pressed <kbd>v</kbd>, it would toggle back and forth to verbose mode. It no longer does this.\r\n2. Previously, when an installation crashed, it would print out the contents of the `package.py` and point to where it crashed. Now it prints out both the `package.py` and the method that calls it. The latter is quite long, and requires the user to scroll up pretty far to find the `spack-build.out`. I don't think we need the latter.\r\n",
