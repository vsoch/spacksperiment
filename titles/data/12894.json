    "body": "Spack doesn't need `requests`, and neither does `jsonschema`, but `jsonschema` tries to import it, and it'll succeed if `requests` is on your machine (which is likely, given how popular it is).  This commit removes the import in our vendored `jsonschema` to improve Spack's startup time a bit.  (see https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/3213).\r\n\r\nOn my mac, the import of requests is ~28% of Spack's startup time when run as `spack --print-shell-vars sh,modules` (.069 / .25 seconds), which is what `setup-env.sh` runs.\r\n\r\nOn a Linux cluster where Python is mounted from NFS, this reduces `setup-env.sh` source time from ~1s to .75s.\r\n\r\nNote: This issue will be eliminated if we upgrade to a newer `jsonschema` (we'd need to drop Python 2.6 for that).  See https://github.com/Julian/jsonschema/pull/388.",
