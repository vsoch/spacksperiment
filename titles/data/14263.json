It also fixes a number of correctness issues with the transaction classes in `llnl.util.lock`.\r\n\r\nPerformance stuff:\r\n- [x] `ViewDescriptor.regenerate()` checks repeatedly whether packages are installed and also does a lot of DB queries -- put a read transaction around `regenerate()` to avoid repeatedly locking and unlocking the DB.\r\n- [x] add read transactions for similar reasons around `Environment.install()` and `Environment.install_all()`\r\n- [x] avoid regenerating the view twice in `spack install`\r\n- [x] avoid a call to realpath to save some time in `remove_dead_links()`\r\n- [x] don't recompute DAG hashes of specs when regenerating environments\r\n- [x] don't read `spec.yaml` files from the view twice\r\n\r\nLock stuff:\r\n- [x] fix issue with non-transactional writes in `WriteTransaction`\r\n- [x] ensure that nested write transactions actually write out\r\n- [x] avoid redundant reading at the start of write transactions\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n",
