    "body": "Starting with the upcoming 10.1 release, Dyninst changed the names of\r\nsome cmake args to camel case: LIBELF_* to LibElf_* and LIBDWARF_* to\r\nLibDwarf_*.  This change is needed now for @develop and will be used\r\nfor 10.1 when it is released.\r\n\r\nAlso, Dyninst now requires cmake version 3.4.0 or later.\r\n\r\nFold in the change from PR #11222 for Boost version 1.69.  It's a\r\n1-line change and is needed to build Dyninst now (all versions).\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nping @hainest to check the arg names and if there will be anything\r\nelse for 10.1.\r\n\r\nping @sknigh for the boost version.",
