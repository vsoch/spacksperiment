Is there as way I can generate a lua for this specific installation of icc and which loads the appropriate env variables for a working spack env? I say this because I've run into some issues compiling say ncurses with the system installed version of icc as it complains about unwritable system paths eg.,: \r\n\r\n    /sbin/ldconfig: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission \r\n                 denied\r\n",
