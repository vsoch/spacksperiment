    "body": "+ The additional patch enables a non-optimized random123 code path that will work on ARM architectures. This solution is provided only for version 1.09 to allow the most current version of Random123 to function.\r\n+ A more complete, long term solution will be the addition of a native ARM intrinsics-based implementation of random123.  This solution is being worked on but it is several weeks or months away.  Once the full implementation is available it will be provided to the author/maintainer of Random123.",
