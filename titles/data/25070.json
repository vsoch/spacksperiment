    "body": "I am attempting to build superlu-mt +blas %nvhpc using nvhpc+blas as the provider for BLAS, but the build is failing due to undefined references to various aio_* symbols.  Thus does not occur when I try an otherwise identical build for superlu-mt~blas.\r\n\r\nIn debugging, I see that spack's nvhpc recipe  adds -lnvf to the compilation lines when using LAPACK from nvhpc, which has the various aio_* symbols.  And if I try to manually compile some simple Lapack example codes, I am required to link in libnvf.so and then librt.so.\r\n\r\nAs a test, I hacked the superlu-mt recipe to add the -lrt flag when building if the blas provider is nvhpc, then I can successfully build the package.\r\n\r\nWhile I could simply do that (or add libaio as a dependency for superlu-mt when blas provider is nvhpc), I am unsure if that is the proper solution.\r\n1) This seems to be a nvhpc+lapack issue, as the libnvf.so library (part of nvhpc) being added when nvhpc's lapack is used has a dependency on the aio library, and I think that this should be fixed in nvhpc, not in every package depending on lapack or blas.\r\n\r\n2) I see spack has its own libaio package, so I _think_ it should be linking against that and not the system installed one via -lrt.  But I am not 100% sure, as even when spack \"builds\" nvhpc, it is not really building it but just wrapping a binary install.\r\n\r\n3) If the proper solution is to have the -lrt flag added whenever a package is built using nvhpc as the BLAS provider, I am unsure how to modify the nvhpc package to accomplish that.\r\n\r\n4) I can add libaio as a dependency to nvhpc, but that did not seem to do the trick (although that could possibly be because I am using an nvhpc declared as an external package to spack).\r\n\r\nAdvice would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install superlu-mt@3.1%nvhpc \" +blas~int64+openmp+pic~pthread\r\n...\r\n/software/spack/git.2021.04.28/lib/spack/env/nvhpc/nvc -mp -D__OPENMP -fpic -DAdd_ -I../SRC -c sp_ienv.c\r\n/software/spack/git.2021.04.28/lib/spack/env/nvhpc/nvc -mp -fpic psdrive.o sp_sconvert.o psgst01.o psgst02.o psgst04.o psgst07.o psgssv.o psgssvx.o sp_ienv.o \\\r\nlibtmglib.a ../lib/libsuperlu_mt_OPENMP.a -L/software/nvhpc/21.5/linux-rhel8-x86_64/Linux_x86_64/21.5/compilers/lib -lblas -llapack -lnvf -lm -mp -o pstest\r\n/software/nvhpc/21.5/linux-rhel8-x86_64/Linux_x86_64/21.5/compilers/lib/libnvf.so: undefined reference to `aio_return'\r\n/software/nvhpc/21.5/linux-rhel8-x86_64/Linux_x86_64/21.5/compilers/lib/libnvf.so: undefined reference to `aio_read'\r\n/software/nvhpc/21.5/linux-rhel8-x86_64/Linux_x86_64/21.5/compilers/lib/libnvf.so: undefined reference to `aio_error'\r\n/software/nvhpc/21.5/linux-rhel8-x86_64/Linux_x86_64/21.5/compilers/lib/libnvf.so: undefined reference to `aio_write'\r\n/software/nvhpc/21.5/linux-rhel8-x86_64/Linux_x86_64/21.5/compilers/lib/libnvf.so: undefined reference to `aio_suspend'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2429-f5e6c32495\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-x86_64\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, I am using an manually installed nvhpc@21.5 defined as an external package to spack, i.e.\r\n```console\r\n  nvhpc:\r\n    version: [21.5]\r\n    variants: +blas install_type=single +lapack +mpi\r\n    compiler:: [nvc@21.5]\r\n    buildable: false\r\n    externals:\r\n        - spec: 'nvhpc@21.5 %nvhpc@21.5 +blas install_type=single +lapack +mpi'\r\n          prefix: /software/nvhpc/21.5/linux-rhel8-x86_64/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because if I install nvhpc using spack, spack needs a compiler to install it with (even though there is no actual compilation), and then when I attempt to use nvhpc as a provider for blas, etc., spack tries to install again using the nvhpc compiler.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6871415/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6871416/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n\r\nNo maintainers for superlu-mt\r\n@samcmill is the maintainer for nvhpc\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures.
