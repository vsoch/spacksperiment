    "body": "@scottwittenburg @gartung \r\n\r\n@becker33 this will fix some broken symlinks for bzip2, for example. However, it may not be essential, as from what I can tell most packages don't use the extra symlinks (e.g. `bzegrep`) that are broken.\r\n\r\nBinary caches of packages with absolute symlinks had broken symlinks. From what I can tell, tar doesn't support any notion of matching source/destination roots when unpacking an archive with absolute symlinks. Therefore, this commit just makes a copy of any file that is a symlink while creating a binary cache of a package.",
