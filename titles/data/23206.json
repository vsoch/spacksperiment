Seems to be connected to the `url_for_version` convention the package uses.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n~/repo/spack (develop)$ spack versions  -s edm4hep\r\n==> Safe versions (already checksummed):\r\n  master  0.3.1  0.3\r\n~/repo/spack (develop)$ spack versions  -r edm4hep\r\n==> Remote versions (not yet checksummed):\r\n  00-02-01  00-02  00-01  00-00\r\n~/repo/spack (develop)$ spack versions  -n edm4hep\r\n==> New remote versions (not yet checksummed):\r\n  00-03-01\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n~/repo/spack (lcg-develop)$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-213-63f483a5c0\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n\r\nI'll look into this, opening this issue to keep track.\r\n",
