    "body": "This pull request contains changes to support Google Cloud Storage buckets as mirrors, meant for hosting Spack build-caches. This feature is beneficial for folks that are running infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform. On public cloud systems, resources are ephemeral and in many cases, installing compilers, MPI flavors, and user packages from scratch takes up considerable time. \r\n\r\nGiving users the ability to host a Spack mirror that can store build caches in GCS buckets offers a clean solution for reducing application rebuilds for Google Cloud infrastructure.",
