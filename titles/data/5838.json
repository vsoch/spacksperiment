    "body": "Chasing a performance regression has lead me to this change, going from default optimization gives a significant performance win. The sweet spot for zlib is apparently `-O2`, both `-Ofast` and `-O3` are slightly worse (regression is about 3% compared with `-O2`) in my testing. \r\n\r\nHappy to share my methodology with people so we can benchmark on a wider variety of systems.",
