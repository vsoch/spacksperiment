    "body": "Standard BLAS routines expect 32-bit integers, which is insufficient on some modern 64-bit systems with large amounts of memory. This variant builds a 64-bit version of OpenBLAS as well, which expects 64-bit integers (and adds a suffix \"64_\" to function names).\n\nThis variant requires a tool \"objconv\" that is also packaged.\n",
