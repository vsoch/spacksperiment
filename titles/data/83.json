    "body": "Hi,\n\nI have a package based on gnu makefiles to build which requires to add specific mpif90 options like:\n\n```\n$ MPIFC := /usr/bin/mpif90  -ffree-form -ffree-line-length-0 -I/usr/lib/openmpi/include -I/usr/lib/openmpi/lib\n$ FC := $(MPIFC)\n```\n\nUnfortunately, It seems that when Spack intercepts the compiler it removes these options.\n\nIs there a way to add MPI compiler options in the package?\n\nThanks,\nFlorent\n",
