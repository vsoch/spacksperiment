It crashed during configure, but it's happy now.\n\nWhile I was at it, I noticed hdf actually has an pretty intensive test suite. It only took 30 seconds to run, but it seems to check a lot of things, so I think it's good to include.\n\nAlso, Spack has finally gotten smart enough where the url_for_version function is no longer necessary, so I removed it.\n",
