    "body": "Package `slate` relies on sub-repo `testsweeper`, which uses a Python configure script that has byte+str concatenation errors when run with Python 3. This PR uses `filter_file` on the `testsweeper` configure script to mend the offending lines (4 lines in total). Obviously it would be preferable to have an upstream fix in the `testsweeper` repo but for now this allows `slate` to build.\r\n\r\nTemporarily addresses https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/15216\r\n\r\n@G-Ragghianti ",
