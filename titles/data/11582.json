    "body": "Some compilers (eg Intel) require modules to load.  Traditionally, they can only be used by loading the required modules and then using `spack --dirty`.  Apparently, there's another way to use them, an \"rpath trick.\"  See below.  This needs to be added to the documentation.\r\n\r\nOn Wed, May 29, 2019 at 11:44 AM 'Kenneth Moreland' via Spack <spack@googlegroups.com> wrote:\r\nBili,\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip.
