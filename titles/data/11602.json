This has two effects:\r\n\r\n* environment spack.yaml files expect to retain comments, which load_config now supports. By using load_config, users can now use the ':' override syntax that was previously unavailable for environment configs (but was available for other config files).\r\n* config files now retain user comments by default (although in cases where Spack updates/overwrites config, the comments can still be removed).\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\n* Subclasses `RoundTripLoader`/`RoundTripDumper` to parse yaml into ruamel's `CommentedMap` and analogous data structures\r\n* Applies filename info directly to ruamel objects in cases where the updated loader returns those\r\n* Copies management of sections in `SingleFileScope` from #10651 to allow overrides to occur\r\n* Updates the loader/dumper to handle the processing of overrides by specifically checking for the `:` character\r\n  * Possibly the most controversial aspect, but without that, the parsed objects have to be reconstructed (i.e. as was done in `mark_overrides`). It is possible that `mark_overrides` could remain and a deep copy will not cause problems, but IMO that's generally worth avoiding.\r\n  * This is also possibly controversial because Spack YAML strings can include `:`. My reckoning is that this only occurs for version specifications, so it is safe to check for `endswith(':') and not ('@' in string)`\r\n  * As a consequence, this PR ends up reserving spack yaml functions load_config/dump_config exclusively for the purpose of storing spack config",
