    "body": "##### Modifications\n- [x] removed explicit `os.fork()` in favor of `multiprocessing.Process`\n- [x] `log_output` logic has been modified and does not require calls to `sys.settrace` anymore\n- [x] we can throw from `Package.do_install.build_process` and the exceptions are propagated to parent process\n##### Changes in `log_ouput`\n\nIn `develop` : \n- on `__enter__` the parent process forks , set his frame explicitly to avoid executing twice the same code (quite fragile to re-positioning of the `with` statement) ,  reads from a pipe and writes to file\n- on `__enter__` the child does the necessary to write to a pipe and then returns for execution\n\nIn the PR:\n- a \"daemonic\" child is spawned in the `acquire` method and is set to read from the pipe\n- the context manager just changes where the parent writes when needed\n- everything is cleaned in the `release` method\n##### Notes\n\nIn #1186 I wanted to be able to forward exceptions to parent to have a neater workflow in `do_install`. As I saw a couple of `TODOs` referring to the same issue, I extracted this PR. This has also the great advantage of not tweaking with `sys.settrace` and frames (which is a major pain for the debugger sometimes).\n",
