    "body": "<!-- Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\nExample: \"I ran `spack find` to list all the installed packages and ...\" -->\r\nThere are quite a few cases where I run into situation where a package picks up wrong version of dependencies in my environment. For example, `spack install font-util` runs a wrong version of `fc-cache` in `/usr/bin` to install the fonts but failed. Another example is, the configure phase of `spack install r` picks up a bunch of dependencies in my home directory that are not part of spack:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nchecking for a BSD-compatible install... /home/aznable/local/bin/ginstall -c\r\nchecking for sed... /home/aznable/local/bin/sed\r\nchecking for which... /bin/which\r\nchecking for less... /bin/less\r\nchecking for gtar... /bin/gtar\r\nchecking for tex... /home/aznable/local/bin/tex\r\nchecking for pdftex... /home/aznable/local/bin/pdftex\r\nchecking for pdflatex... /home/aznable/local/bin/pdflatex\r\nchecking for makeindex... /home/aznable/local/bin/makeindex\r\nchecking for texi2any... /home/aznable/local/bin/texi2any\r\nchecking whether texi2any version is at least 5.1... yes\r\nchecking for ginstall-info... no\r\nchecking for install-info... /home/aznable/local/bin/install-info\r\nchecking for texi2dvi... /home/aznable/local/bin/texi2dvi\r\nchecking for kpsewhich... /home/aznable/local/bin/kpsewhich\r\nchecking for latex inconsolata package... missing\r\nconfigure: WARNING: neither inconsolata.sty nor zi4.sty found: PDF vignettes and package manuals will not be rendered optimally\r\nchecking for unzip... /home/aznable/local/bin/unzip\r\nchecking for zip... /home/aznable/local/bin/zip\r\nchecking for gzip... /bin/gzip\r\nchecking for bzip2... /home/aznable/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-haswell/gcc-9.3.0/bzip2-1.0.8-mlz6pdrikglamnlrn55am5uvxl4xu6lz/bin/bzip2\r\nchecking for firefox... no\r\nchecking for mozilla... no\r\nchecking for galeon... no\r\nchecking for opera... no\r\nchecking for xdg-open... /bin/xdg-open\r\nusing default browser ... /bin/xdg-open\r\nchecking for acroread... no\r\nchecking for acroread4... no\r\nchecking for xdg-open... /bin/xdg-open\r\nchecking for working aclocal... found\r\nchecking for working autoconf... found\r\nchecking for working autoheader... found\r\nchecking for bison... bison -y\r\nchecking for notangle... false\r\nchecking for realpath... /home/aznable/local/bin/realpath\r\nchecking for pkg-config... /home/aznable/local/bin/pkg-config\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nYet another example is here https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/18749, which is relevant to a few other build issues I have seen when building python packages such as `py-scipy`.\r\n\r\nNote that I have never specified those dependencies as external packages in the spack config file. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install font-util\r\n$ spack install r\r\n$ spack install python@3.8.5\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message.

That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
