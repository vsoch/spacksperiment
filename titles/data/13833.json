    "body": "*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*\r\n\r\nThere are two things that would be desirable to have in Spack:\r\n1. Many packages have multiple sets of tests: unit tests, integration tests, etc. Currently, there is no way to pass an argument to check_install method to run a different test suite. In addition, it would also be desirable to keep record that the installation has passed for a particular package. Perhaps the test suite that ran should be part of spec?\r\n\r\n2. It should be possible to test a package that has already been installed.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nIt is common to validate a package after it is installed.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTwo ideas:\r\n1. --run-tests or --test=<foo> takes an argument that is passed to the check_install method. The tests that are run are stored in the spec.\r\n\r\n2. Requires a lot more thought. You would have to save the tests from the original build, plus possible keep the source files around in case data files are need to run the tests. Not sure that this is feasible for most packages.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nI would be content if you implement the just the first of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!",
