We are not affiliated with gperftools otherwise, but agree to try to add new versions when they're available. I've subscribed to the releases for gperftools on GitHub, so I hope I'll be able to add new versions relatively quickly. @teonnik I did not actually check with you if you're ok with this. Are you? If not I don't mind removing you.",
