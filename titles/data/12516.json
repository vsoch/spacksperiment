It also ensures the permissions of directories created above `$user` on the first accessible such path are inherited from the parent directory and the permissions of those at `$user` and any associated subdirectories are private to the `$user`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes `spack clean` to only remove stage directories that end in a hash.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Update docs (since issues can still arise with some directory layouts)\r\n- [x] Filter stage directories purged by `spack clean` so only remove those with hashes\r\n- [x] Eliminate redundant `$user/$user` (e.g., when `$tempdir` includes `$user`)\r\n- [x] Add tests\r\n- [x] Add user-specific default backup to `config:build_stage`\r\n- [x] Add old Spack instance stage directory as commented out default backup\r\n- [x] Remove (LLNL) site-specific `config:build_stage` directories from documentation\r\n- [x] Clarify ties between `config:build_stage` and `spack clean` in documentation\r\n- [x] Move `can_access` check in `_first_accessible_path` to bottom of `_create_stage_root`",
