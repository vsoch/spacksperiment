    "body": "The changes in this pull request fix SSL for older Python versions by adding a new `patch` function and by adding dependency constraints.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: I've only verified that these fixes work for the variant `python@2.7.12+ssl` with a build environment of `gcc%4.9.3 arch=linux-rhel7-broadwell`, so this should remain a WIP until I've more thoroughly tested the correctness of these changes. I'm planning to at least test  `python@2.7.18+ssl`, `python@3.4.X+ssl`, and `python@3.6.X+ssl` to ensure that the patch and constraints work for the advertised versions.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: I've now tested `python@2.7.18{+|~}ssl` and `python@3.6.8{+|~}ssl`. I skipped `python@3.4.3+ssl` because it seems like it would be redundant given that the patches in this PR work for a more recent version (i.e.  `python@3.6.8`).",
