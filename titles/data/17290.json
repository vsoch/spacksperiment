    "body": "@adamjstewart @alalazo \r\nI'd like some feedback about this one. \r\n\r\n* I have had to make several fixes, and installation works. but I am not sure if this is the \"spack-recommended\" way. so let me know if there is a better way to perform these tasks (left a bunch of comments in the package.py)\r\n\r\n* There are some issues why even the \"released\" versions/tags don't work out of the box. I have tried to fix 1.5.3 (which I used last year) and 1.6.3 (which I plan to use now).  I don't really want to spend time on testing the installation of others.\r\n\r\n* I am not sure why I see the egg as a file, and not inflated directory (on powerpc with python3.7.6). i have put in a manual inflate step, but this needs to be figured out.\r\n",
