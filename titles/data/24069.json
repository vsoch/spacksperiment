And it's because we're human :laughing: But maybe we can help with some automation?\r\n\r\nI found this tool typos (a rust library) and created a GitHub action for it this weekend. If we run it during CI, it can alert us to spelling errors! I am currently running for the spack docs and spack root, and we can add other spack subfolders when --exclude is supported (see issue https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/issues/269) \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
