It looks like there are several other modules that don't yet have variants. We need to add variants for these and figure out which versions they are valid for\r\n2. There may be other variants that are missing conflicts. Is there a way to crash instead of silently fail?\r\n3. Need to figure out a better way to handle `+contrib` so it doesn't get forgotten. Can we loop through all versions of the package?\r\n\r\n@bvanessen can you review? Those future work suggestions are just suggestions, they probably won't happen in this PR but feel free to take a stab at them if you want in a follow-up PR.",
