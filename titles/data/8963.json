    "body": "### EDIT\r\nJust discovered a duplicate from #8924. Can be closed\r\n\r\n### TL;DR \r\nThe URL used by bzip2 recipe, `http://www.bzip.org`, seems not available anymore and now, Spack is not able to install it nor any package depending on it (Git in my case, required by the Gettext package).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI have no idea whether it is temporary or not. In the meantime, it is not possible to install `bzip2`from Spack since the URL `bzip.org` does not refers to the actual project. A website is still reachable at this URL.\r\n\r\nThis is not a issue with Spack but, in the meantime, it is not possible to install any package depending on it.\r\nI could set up a Github repo & tarballs but I think someone probably hosts one somewhere.\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\nInstall `bzip2`properly.\r\n\r\n### Actual Result\r\n\r\nIt did not install, obviously, with the following output:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install bzip2\r\n==> Installing bzip2\r\n==> Fetching http://www.bzip.org/1.0.6/bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz\r\n######################################################################### 100,0%\r\n==> Warning: The contents of\r\n  the archive\r\n   look like HTML.\r\n  The checksum will likely be bad.  If it is, you can use\r\n  'spack clean <package>' to remove the bad archive, then\r\n  fix your internet gateway issue and install again.\r\n==> Error: ChecksumError: md5 checksum failed for /spack/var/spack/stage/bzip2-1.0.6-lm4lp2bp22i2fmz3amqd2stay22wq6oh/bzip2-1.0.6.tar.gz\r\n    Expected 00b516f4704d4a7cb50a1d97e6e8e15b but got ef1d6942767c9caca49f51f2d5cbf931\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install bzip2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ uname -r\r\n4.17.3-200.fc28.x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd absolutely no exotic configuration at all.\r\n 1. which platform you are using\r\n 2. any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.)",
