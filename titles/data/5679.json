    "body": "I had a PR ready to go, but figured There was some discussion to be had. Clear Linux increments their distro's version number with each bundle update. Right now a test image is running version 18240 and will likely be at 18270 by the time you read this. This means that the version detection in: lib/spack/spack/operating_systems/linux_distro.py isn't as useful as it is on a distro with slowly changing version numbers. They do supply an /etc/os-release file, but it trips up Spack as the id returned by distro.linux_distribution contains a string with dashes. There is a VERSION field in the /etc/os-release that doesn't seem to move quite as quickly, leading me to this abomination:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/lib/spack/spack/operating_systems/linux_distro.py b/lib/spack/spack/operating_systems/linux_distro.py\r\nindex 7d1e3ca00..1ff309a0f 100644\r\n--- a/lib/spack/spack/operating_systems/linux_distro.py\r\n+++ b/lib/spack/spack/operating_systems/linux_distro.py\r\n@@ -55,4 +55,13 @@ class LinuxDistro(OperatingSystem):\r\n         else:\r\n             version = version[0]\r\n \r\n+        if 'clear' in distname:        \r\n+            distname = 'clear'         \r\n+            version = '1'\r\n+            with open('/etc/os-release') as os_release:\r\n+                for line in os_release:\r\n+                    if line.startswith('VERSION='):\r\n+                        version=line.lstrip('VERSION=')\r\n+                        version=version.strip()\r\n+\r\n         super(LinuxDistro, self).__init__(distname, version)\r\n```\r\n\r\ndoes anyone have any better suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
