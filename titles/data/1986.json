    "body": "I frequently need to debug a failed build in spack.  At least for cmake-based packages, this would be much easier if the project was configured with `-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON` or equivalently, make was run with the option `VERBOSE=ON`.  Could one of these be the default?  This would save the detailed build instructions into spack-build.out, which is useful IMHO.  If that is not reasonable, maybe we could have a `-V` (very verbose) option for `spack install.`\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAre there similar tricks that can be played with other build tools to increase their output verbosity?\n",
