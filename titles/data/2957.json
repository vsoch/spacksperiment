    "body": "As discussed in #2716 , HTTP retrieval URLs work better behind a firewall. This commit repalcse FTP retrieval URLs with HTTP ones serving packages with identical checksum. Luckily, all FTP urls in spack packages seem to have alternative HTTP urls.\r\n\r\nThese chages have been made manually and no checksum changes are made. Tests run sucessfully against `spack test package`.\r\n\r\nTo proceed, I plan to add a test in `package_sanity` to check if HTTP is favored over FTP when HTTP is available for the retrieval site.",
