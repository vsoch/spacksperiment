The section of the spack docs on transitive-dependencies [extol the virtues of the RPATH approach](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows.html#transitive-dependencies) and it's one of the things that attracts me to Spack.\r\n\r\nOf the three problematic cases that section discusses, it seems that only 2) & 3) require providing a `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` (and arguably that's a bug) and I'd expect that to be rare.\r\n\r\nI know that I can add `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`  to the `environment_blacklist` in the `modules.yaml` file, but I wonder how many surprises are lurking down that road.\r\n\r\nWould it be better to *not* automagically set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and force packages that require it (e.g. Python extensions) to explicitly provide it?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFWIW, I ran into this when I was trying to understand why UGE was telling me that it was stripping LD_LIBRARY_PATH from my `qsub -V`-ed job but that it appeared to be set anyway....",
