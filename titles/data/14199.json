    "body": "Allow mirroring (both source and build caches) from remote servers over SSH.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWe have several institutional clusters on which we install approximately daily development updates of our export-controlled code for user testing. I'd like to improve deployment time and assuring quality by building with Spack as part of the CI system, then distributing that tested binary directly to the other servers.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIdeally a remote server could be added with `ssh://` or `scp://` as opposed to the currently supported `https://`, `file://`, `s3://` etc.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/6937 asking whether SSH is currently implemented.",
