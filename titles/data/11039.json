    "body": "PR #10758 made a slight change to find_versions_of_archive() which included\r\narchive_url in the search process. While this fixed `spack create` and\r\n`spack checksum` missing command-line arguments, it caused `spack\r\ninstall` to prefer those URLs over those it found in the scrape process.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the package url was treated as a list_url causing all R\r\npackages to stop fetching once the package was updated on CRAN.\r\n\r\nThis patch is more selective about including the archive_url in the\r\nremote versions, explicitly overriding it with matching versions found\r\nby the scraper.",
