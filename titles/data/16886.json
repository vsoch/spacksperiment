To remove packages that are needed only at build time and were not explicitly installed see `spack gc -h`.\r\n\r\nWhen using the --all option ALL packages matching the supplied specs will be uninstalled. For instance, `spack uninstall --all libelf` uninstalls all the versions of `libelf` currently present in Spack's store. If no spec is supplied, all installed packages will be uninstalled. If used in an environment, all packages in the environment will be uninstalled.\r\n```",
