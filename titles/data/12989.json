    "body": "Currently, we assume the cray platform can be identified by the default modules\r\n\r\nWe have discovered a cray machine on which the default modules are `No modules loaded`.\r\n\r\nThis caused some problems for Spack's platform detection and OS setup. This PR allows Spack to persevere despite those problems. In the worst case in which the `cle_release` files have been removed from the system, we will continue with `os=cnlunknown` instead of failing immediately.\r\n\r\nNOTE 2019-10-01: The scope of this PR has expanded to include a set of hotfixes found/used at an internal hackathon at LLNL.",
