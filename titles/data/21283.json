It's frustrating to spend time on commit messages only to have it discarded when the PR is merged.\r\n\r\nI understand the rationale of squashing commits when merging, it allows to \"clean up\" PRs that have many fix-up commits. But it should still keep the full commit messages, especially when a PR only has a single commit.",
