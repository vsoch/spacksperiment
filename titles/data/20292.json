Installs a mock package \r\n2. Modifies the corresponding `package.py`\r\n3. Uses the installation at 1 to satisfy a dependency for another package\r\n\r\nand verify that it concretize correctly.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nCurrently this is broken both with the original concretizer and the new concretizer. The original concretizer treats correctly the case where a variant is added to `package.py`, but fails if a variant is removed:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack spec hdf5~mpi ^/tc5xvfd\r\nInput spec\r\n--------------------------------\r\nhdf5~mpi\r\n    ^zlib@1.2.11%gcc@10.1.0+optimize+pic+shared arch=linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64\r\n\r\nConcretized\r\n--------------------------------\r\n==> Error: trying to set variant \"pic\" in package \"zlib\", but the package has no such variant [happened during concretization of hdf5@1.10.7%gcc@10.1.0~cxx~debug~fortran~hl~java~mpi+pic+shared~szip~threadsafe api=none arch=linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64 ^zlib@1.2.11%gcc@10.1.0+optimize+pic+shared arch=linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64]\r\n```\r\nThe new concretizer fails with the same error if a variant is removed:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack solve hdf5~mpi ^/tc5xvfd\r\n==> Error: trying to set variant \"pic\" in package \"zlib\", but the package has no such variant [happened during concretization of hdf5~mpi ^zlib@1.2.11%gcc@10.1.0+optimize+pic+shared arch=linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64]\r\n```\r\nand adds an additional variant with its default value if a variant is added (which is wrong).\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
