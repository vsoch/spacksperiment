    "body": "Hi I am curious to know some of the differences between `spack` and the portage package manager?\r\n\r\nAdditionally which package manager is easier to understand in terms of configurations between the two package managers?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith `pacman` if I don't update my system in a long time (specfically with Arch-based systems) then I end up running into all sorts of erros and then I have to manually fix the errors. Is it ok with `spack` if I don't update my system in a very long time, would there be any sort of issues if I update it a long time after?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCan `spack` be used with LFS (Linux From Scratch) and it is used as a normal/default package manager?",
