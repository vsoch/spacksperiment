    "body": "Many perl scripts in the magics source distribution invoke the system perl via `#!/usr/bin/perl`. However, the system perl may not include the package XML::Parser, as I found on one of the systems I use. Patching the files to invoke perl via `#!/usr/bin/env perl` fixes the problem. This patch can be safely applied to all versions of magics.",
