    "body": "I was surprised by a new variant name in OpenBLAS being mixed case (https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/14876), since I thought variants were strictly `[a-z0-9-]+`. A grep of `builtin/packages/*/package.py` shows a number of inconsistencies:\r\n- That new `consistentFPCSR` variant is the only variant in any package to have mixed case\r\n- The only other variants to have upper case are `X`, `X11`, and a variant `K` in the `eem` package\r\n- `X`, `X11`, `x`, and `x11`  are all variants meaning \"require the `libx11` package\"\r\n- Most variants use underscores for separators if at all, but some use hyphens\r\n- There are surely gobs more.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n1. Is there a point at which we unify these variant names?\r\n2. Is there documentation for best practices? (see https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/557 but a quick check in the [packaging guide](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#variants) and [packaging creation tutorial](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_packaging.html#variants) revealed nothing)\r\n3. How can we prevent new odd cases from creeping in during MRs?",
