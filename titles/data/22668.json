In particular it could be useful to only build static libs so that squashfuse/mksquash can easily create binaries without dependencies for simple deployment.\r\n\r\nAlso adds missing optional dependencies for the executables.\r\n\r\nNote that cmake does not have all these warning flags that were patched for the nvhpc compiler\r\n",
