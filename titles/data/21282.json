    "body": "<!--*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*-->\r\n\r\nDetermine how to incorporate the nix dependency model (see https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html) into the spack dependency model (see https://github.com/spack/build-si-modeling) and determine what nix operations spack would need to run (e.g. https://nixos.org/guides/towards-reproducibility-pinning-nixpkgs.html).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nSee in-progress spack/build-si-modeling#2 -- it would be cool to determine where (if any) the spack dependency model falls down. Relatedly, it would be cool to determine if it can be extended to cover those cases without adding a ton of new syntax. Nix contains one definition of a package graph e.g. https://nixos.org/guides/towards-reproducibility-pinning-nixpkgs.html -- their focus on reproducibility is not shared with spack, but it could be cool to e.g. explicitly enable reproducibility, if nix offers any such functionality not easily accessible with spack.\r\n\r\n<!--*Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it!*-->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!--*Describe the solution you'd like and the alternatives you have considered.*-->\r\nA NixPackage build system would not address any of the above problems by itself, but it could be a convenient guise for iteratively demonstrating that spack is able to cover any new facets of nix functionality mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n<!--*Add any other context about the feature request here.*-->\r\nRegarding reproducibility, if the result of concretization could be cached in a way that somehow respects all platforms, we would have an alternate answer to #20207. The details of reproducibility presented at https://nixos.org/guides/towards-reproducibility-pinning-nixpkgs.html / https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html could be one guide to accomplishing that alternate goal.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack: `0.16.0-971-bc0cc073d0`.\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
