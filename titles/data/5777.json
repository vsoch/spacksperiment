    "body": "Currently the `find` function and hence `find_libraries` as well as `find_system_libraries` raise an `OSError` if the `root` path of their search does not exist. In my opinion it makes more sense to return an empty dictionary instead.\r\n\r\nNote, that this probably affects many packages which use `find`, `find_libraries` or variants thereof. I initially encountered the error while installing `armadillo` on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine, where arpack is placed in a `lib` subfolder and not `lib64` as the `armadillo` Spack package expects it.\r\n\r\nI fix that issue in the second commit. My point is, that this requires the extra explicit check whether the returned `LibraryList` is not empty. I am not really happy about this boilerplate, so please point me in a proper direction if you have a better idea how to fix this issue without potentially silently breaking the installation process of other packages.",
