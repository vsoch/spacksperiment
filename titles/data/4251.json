    "body": "I've been playing around with Spack's Lmod support and so far most things are great. One problem I discovered is a discrepancy between Spack's version detection for PGI and the versions we use for the PGI package. In the `pgi` package, we have versions like `17.4`. But when I install the compiler with Spack and add it to `compilers.yaml` with `spack compiler find`, it detects the version as `17.4-0`. This is fine, unless you use Lmod. When I run `module load pgi`, it appends the following directory to my `MODULEPATH`:\r\n```\r\n$SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/lmod/linux-centos7-x86_64/pgi/17.4\r\n```\r\nunfortunately, Spack writes module files for things built with PGI to:\r\n```\r\n$SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/lmod/linux-centos7-x86_64/pgi/17.4-0\r\n```\r\nso none of these modules appear in `module avail`.\r\n\r\nWe have 2 options to fix this:\r\n\r\n1. Change our PGI version detection to pick up `17.4` instead of `17.4-0`\r\n2. Change the PGI package to contain versions for `17.4-0` instead of `17.4`\r\n\r\nI chose the former option, but if people prefer the latter I can go down that route too.",
