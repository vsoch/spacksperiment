[spack-build.out.txt](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/687914/spack-build.out.txt)\r\n\r\nThe problem is, it's not able to find `libpng` --- not with `pkg-config`, and not with an env var telling `freetype` where it is:\r\n```\r\nchecking for LIBPNG... no\r\nchecking for libpng-config... Package libpng was not found in the pkg-config search path.\r\nPerhaps you should add the directory containing `libpng.pc'\r\nto the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how to resolve this?  (Other than using a Spack-built `libpng`, which is what I'm doing now)?\r\n\r\n",
