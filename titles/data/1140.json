    "body": "The licensed software documentation looks a bit incomplete. Some places look like they are missing images to show examples of how the global license file looks like and also another for how to use a license from another server.\n\nAlso, I think it might be helpful to add an example about a package that has multiple licenses. For example, a user at NERSC was trying to install allinea-forge and had two licenses, license.ddt and license.map. They thought that when Spack prompted them to use the global file that there would be two global files for each specified license. So it might be helpful to mention that all licenses should be placed in the global file, or something like that. \n",
