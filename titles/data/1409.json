    "body": "Currently, for the same package with the same dependencies, the hash may change depending on python internals.\n\n`Spec.dag_hash` is created from a hash of a `dict` (via a yaml dump to string). However, `dict` is not ordered, so the same `dict` is not guaranteed to print out in the same order every time.\n\nI see this happening when calling spack directly from a [salt](https://github.com/UCL-RITS/CondimentStation/blob/master/_modules/spack.py) plugin, or when calling the same methods from the ipython commandline.\n\nOne possible change could be to hash the full-spec of the package, as implemented in `Spec.__str__`.\n",
