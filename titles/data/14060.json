I realize this kinda sucks right now, but I'm hoping it will make future updates here less painful.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of future updates, this should really have AMD offload as well, but we don't have an AOMP package, so that's going to be next.\r\n\r\n@homerdin, I'd appreciate your feedback on this if you have a bit of time, thanks again on the big lift to get the monorepo swap done.",
