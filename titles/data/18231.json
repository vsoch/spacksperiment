Right now spack has it's own caching system, but this doesn't allow for distributed compiles or caching downloads with appllications outside of spack.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt should be pretty straightforward to get the underlying spack downloads and compiles to be done via distcc and squid.  It looks like a configuration issue that requires minimal code changes.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nThis might be something someone has already done.\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [ X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n",
