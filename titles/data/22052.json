    "body": "I'm having discussion with @alecbcs,  and we think it would be really useful to have a release key (or support for custom metadata) in a spack.yaml file. You can follow our discussion [here](https://github.com/autamus/spacktainer-registry/pull/2#issuecomment-789367605), but basically if we are building containers from spack.yaml files, we'd want to bump the version in the spack.yaml file. We could easily add the key (and likely there wouldn't be an issue if spack doesn't validate the structure and not allow extra keys, I know spack uses jsonschema which is why I'm asking specifically) but in the case that it could be useful to other users, I thought I'd open it up here.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
