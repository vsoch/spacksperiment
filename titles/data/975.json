I spoke with the developer, but he didn't seem too interested in packaging it in this way. I ended up using a mirror, which should be fine for our purposes. See #823 for relevant discussion.\n\nI would also like to build this package for multiple architectures, as mentioned in #974. Any suggestions for that would be appreciated.\n",
