The idea for this PR started, when I added a newer git version and the sha256 that `spack` got wasn't the one from the signed document linked above. kernel.org is kind of anal regarding chain of trust, so I'd prefer using their infrastructure as much as possible rather than github.com's autogenerated tar-balls (where they don't guarantee checksum stability).\r\nI basically replaced all md5sums into sha256s and moved the url to kernel.org",
