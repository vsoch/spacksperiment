    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nI have narrowed down the issue as follows:\r\n```\r\n$ spack install spack install slate~cuda+mpi+openmp%gcc@8.3.0 ^mpich ^intel-mkl@2020.1.217 threads=none\r\n```\r\nfails and gives several `./lib/libslate.so: undefined reference to 'GOMP_taskloop'` errors\r\n\r\nHowever, if you do:\r\n```\r\n$ spack install spack install slate~cuda+mpi+openmp%gcc@8.3.0 ^mpich ^intel-mkl@2020.1.217 threads=openmp\r\n```\r\nit succeeds. I am not sure if the intention is to support sequential MKL with OpenMP variant of SLATE. If this combination is supposed to work, it would be a desirable user-facing change to make the dependency on MKL more explicit. Especially since the default intel-mkl variant is `threads=none`. \r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n[naromero@naromero-desktop ~]$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2-1339-76abf3581\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.9\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu18.04-westmere\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
