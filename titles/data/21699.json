    "body": "1. None of the currently enabled env variables apply to Fortran (at least on linux/mac), so the user still has to set -I flags regardless; this is because we don't set CPATH for reasons in other issues.\r\n2. The Cray compiler has a bug where it does not set `-I` flags for its own packages when the path is in C_INCLUDE_PATH (ref https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/21696). This means that `spack load cray-mpich` makes `ftn mpiprogram.f90` fail to compile.",
