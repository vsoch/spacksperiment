    "body": "Made the vcvars batch script location a member variable of the msvc Compiler subclass, initialized from the compiler executable path.  Added a setup_custom_environment() method to the msvc subclass that sources the vcvars script, dumps the environment, and copies the relevant environment variables to the Spack environment.  Added class variables to the Windows OS and MSVC compiler subclasses to enable finding the compiler executables and determining their versions.",
