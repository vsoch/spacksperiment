There was a bug in missing a call to setup_main_options(args) that will now ensure that it works. Thanks to @haampie for the slack discussion about fixing the bug! Note that we decided to add \"command_line\" to the set of scopes for the `mutable_empty_config` fixture, since not having it was probably an oversight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
