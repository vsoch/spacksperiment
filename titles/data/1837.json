    "body": "This PR is a followup to #1828. While investigating comments made by @JavierCVilla, I discovered that Spack has a duplicated package! Both `icu` and `icu4c` were downloading the same tarball. It turns out ICU (International Components for Unicode) provides both a C/C++ interface (ICU4C) and a Java interface (ICU4J). Since the tarball contains the text \"icu4c\" and since there is a separate \"icu4j\" package that could be added, I think it's best to remove `icu` and point everything to `icu4c`.\n",
