    "body": "According to the basemap tutorial (https://basemaptutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/first_map.html), the way to import Basemap is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this failed when I tried it with py-basemap from spack. The py-basemap package was installing into an egg, but the above command assumes that basemap is installed into an existing mpl_toolkits package (part of py-matplotlib).\r\n\r\nBy adding py-setuptools as a dependency at build time, py-basemap installs into a normal directory tree. When py-basemap and py-matplotlib are both activated, the basemap directory is linked into mpl_toolkits, so that the above import statement works correctly.",
