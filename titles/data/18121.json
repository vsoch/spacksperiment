    "body": "Can we consider moving the `spack buildcache check` logic out of the child jobs and into `spack ci generate` or equivalent? Why should we stage out potentially hundreds of CI jobs when we know up-front whether a rebuild of the spec is necessary?\r\n\r\nLet's say someone changes `adios2` package such that *only* `adios2` needs to be updated at the build cache. We have ~240 specs part of `E4S environment` (counting dependencies). Current behavior dictates that that we stage out ~240 downstream CI jobs, one for each spec. One of the first tasks in each of these ~240 downstream jobs is to determine whether the spec is up-to-date at the build cache, and to shutdown if it is. Why should we do this when we have all the knowledge we need *up front* to know which specs need to be rebuilt?\r\n\r\n@scottwittenburg @opadron @tgamblin @shahzebsiddiqui @becker33 ",
