    "body": "SCR moved to a component version some time ago, but never had a\r\nrelease associated with these changes. SCR v2 is a legacy version\r\nthat is no longer being developed/supported. In preparation for an\r\nupcoming SCR v3 release, there is now a 3.0rc1 release available to\r\nusers.\r\nThis adds the 3.0rc1 release to the spack package and deprecates the\r\nolder versions.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include:\r\n- Enforce using the main branches of the components when installing\r\nscr@develop\r\n- Enforce SCR v3 uses at least the recently released versions of each\r\nof the components\r\n- Use a simple `detect_scheduler()` function in an attempt to be\r\nsmarter about setting the default resource manager and not require\r\nusers to always manually provide the variant\r\n- Add/update variants that were recently added to AXL and KVTree\r\ncomponents\r\n- Fix cmake arg naming bug of setting `SCR_CONFIG_FILE`\r\n- `SCR_ASYNC_API` is now being handled by a component and is only\r\nneeded by the legacy versions.\r\n\r\nWe're wanting to expose SCR's logging through Spack as well, but currently\r\nunsure how much to expose. There is an open discussion about this (https://github.com/LLNL/scr/issues/315)\r\nbut it can be added in a future PR if a decision hasn't been made before this\r\nPR has been approved.",
