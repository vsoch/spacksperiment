    "body": "<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2. Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nTrying to install `dd4hep` on my Ubuntu 20.04 machine fails with a rather weird error message from cmake\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install dd4hep+assimp+geant4+lcio+xercesc+hepmc3 ^podio@master\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich leads to the following error\r\n```console\r\n1 error found in build log:\r\n     219    --    /home/tmadlener/tmp/spack_docker_install/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake/gcc-9.3.0/zstd-1.5.0-tlupiwbfa7kzhv6lznimpr5t52jaah4w;\r\n     220    -- CMAKE_MODULE_PATH =\r\n     221    --    /tmp/tmadlener/spack-stage/spack-stage-dd4hep-1.16.1-o3ccmwskwx367bllz74ljhxjrl3ddks5/spack-src/cmake;\r\n     222    -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     223    --\r\n     224    -- Configuring done\r\n  >> 225    CMake Error in DDCAD/CMakeLists.txt:\r\n     226      No known features for C compiler\r\n     227    \r\n     228      \"\"\r\n     229    \r\n     230      version .\r\n     231    \r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like cmake \"forgets\" about the compiler while it is configuring. However, to me this looks weird because the error seems to happen **after** cmake has successfully configured dd4hep. I have tried this with the default `cmake@3.16.3` that comes with Ubuntu 20.04, and also with `cmake@3.18.4` but the error remains unchanged. I don't think it is a problem in dd4heps cmake setup, because I can build it outside of spack. Just to make sure that it is not my spack setup that is causing any problems here, I have run everything in a fresh spack installation with default settings, but the problem remains.\r\n\r\nPinging the maintainers: @vvolkl, @drbenmorgan \r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n```\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-3076-849943c63d\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\nThe `packages.yaml` as populated via `spack external find`.
