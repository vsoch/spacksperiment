    "body": "Modifications : \n- [x] updated trilinos to meet changes in dependencies\n- [x] added `mpi` variant to netcdf (default=`True`, triggers `--enable-parallel`)\n- [x] updated openssl version (older ones cannot be retrieved anymore from the url) see #416 \n- [x] added smarter logic in the computation of openssl URL\n\nKnown issues :\n- trilinos requires `numpy`. Currently one needs to activate it before installing trilinos :\n\n```\nspack install py-numpy\nspack activate numpy\nspack install  trilinos ^ netlib-lapack+shared ^ netlib-blas+fpic\n```\n- build is not working for GCC >= 5.0 (C++11 incompatibilities in some packages)\n\nShould be related to #385 \n\n@adamjstewart : please tell me if the modifications in netcdf are fine with you\n",
