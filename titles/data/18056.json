This is libtool 2.4.6, but the\r\nlibtool: definition of this LT_INIT comes from libtool 2.4.2.\r\nlibtool: You should recreate aclocal.m4 with macros from libtool 2.4.6\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't make much sense, since spack did build libtool@2.4.2 as a\r\ndependency, and was supposedly trying to use it. My guess is that on\r\nthis system (NERSC's cori) the system libtool in /usr/bin, which is\r\n2.4.6 somehow got picked up partially.",
