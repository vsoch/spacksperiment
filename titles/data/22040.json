    "body": "`--test={root,all}` was not propagated to environment installs, which seems like an oversight.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows you to run e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack -e path/to/env install --test=root --verbose\r\n```\r\n\r\nand it will run the tests of the environment root specs.\r\n\r\nIt also supports `spack -e xyz concretize --test=...`.\r\n\r\nMaybe the environment should store a key `test: [root|all]` to ensure that concretization does not depend on a command line flag (e.g. running `spack -e myenv concretize` and then `spack -e myenv install --test=root` does not build test dependencies). But that issue can be fixed in a separate PR.",
