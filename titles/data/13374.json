    "body": "Fixes #3642.\r\n\r\nWe've decided to rename the `spack diy` command to `spack dev-build` to make the use case clearer.\r\n\r\nThe `spack diy` command has some useful functionality for developers using Spack to build their dependencies and configure/build/install the code they are developing. We've realized that as this becomes a developer tool, the name `spack diy` is less useful. Hence the rename.\r\n\r\nThe `spack dev-build` command has a `-u/--until PHASE` option to stop after a given phase of the build. This can be used to configure your project, run cmake on your project, or similarly stop after any stage of the build the user wants. These options are analogous to the existing `spack configure` and `spack build` commands, but for developer builds. To unify the syntax, we have deprecated the `spack configure` and `spack build` commands, and added a `-u/--until PHASE` option to the `spack install` command.\r\n\r\nI believe the functionality in `spack dev-build` (specifically `spack dev-build -u cmake`) can supersede the `spack setup` command, but this PR does not deprecate that command as that will require slightly more thought.\r\n",
