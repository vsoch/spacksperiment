What is the \"spack\" way to actually use them? How do I find the path to the installed library, so that I can use it in my own projects? How do I find the path to the `bin` directory of the `paraview` package, so that I can launch paraview?\r\n\r\nThe only mention I found was in the \"advanced usage\", but I would think this should be the most basic usage:\r\n\r\nhttp://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_sc16_spack_basics.html#advanced-spack-find-usage\r\n\r\nit says that `spack find -pe` will give me the full path to the installed packages, so then I can use it to launch things.",
