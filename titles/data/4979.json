    "body": "See the discussion in #4945 (after the merge) for additional background.\r\n\r\nlibbsd builds with gcc@5.4.0 on CentOS 7, but not with the system's gcc@4.8.5.  Others have reported problems with gcc@4.8.3 on Fedora 19.\r\n\r\nThe problem boils down to the lack of support for the clang extension `__has_include_next`.  The immediate symptom seems to be the pre-processor using defining macro like this\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#define __has_include 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen then tripping over an expansion of it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nblah.h:13:23: error: missing binary operator before token \"(\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the macro definition to:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#define __has_include(X) 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich swallows the arguments with which the macro is invoked.\r\n\r\nThe end result is that libbsd builds for me on CentOS 7 using the system compiler.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure about how to constrain the compiler version, this is the only system I have at hand to test.",
