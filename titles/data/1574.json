    "body": "We build some optional modules as part of plumed, particularly the crystallization module. The existing plumed package has no variants to allow building of optional modules so this change allows the optional building of the three modules that are disabled by default, **crystallization**, **imd**, and **manyrestraints**.\nAdditionally, we're using the intel MPI libraries, installed as an external package, _intelmpi_, and plumed requires an additional configure argument, STATIC_LIBS, or it will try and build the plumed_shared executable with both **-lmpi** and **-lmpi_mt** and fail. I haven't seen this problem in the mailing list (or the plumed mailing list) and our external package is a custom one so I'm willing to see this removed and we just maintain it in a local fork.\n",
