One possible solution would be to submit a PR to https://github.com/github/linguist to add support for Spack spec syntax highlighting. I'm not sure if they'll allow this, since Spack's specs aren't exactly a \"programming language\", but it's worth a shot.\r\n\r\nHere are the instructions for adding support for a new language: https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-language\r\n\r\nIt looks like they require a \"language\" to be popular on GitHub (at least 200 repos use it). Not sure if we can count repos with `spack.yaml` files since that's really just a YAML file, not a Spack spec syntax, but we have plenty of those: https://github.com/search?q=filename%3Aspack.yaml&type=Code\r\n\r\nPinging some main contributors to linguist to see if they have any thoughts on this: @josh @arfon @pchaigno @tnm @Alhadis. If you instead want me to open an issue on https://github.com/github/linguist for discussion let me know.",
