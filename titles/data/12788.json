    "body": "Spack has a system of modular hooks, which are mostly used to do things before and after install.  There is also a `pre_run` hook, which has only been used so far to check the format of `compilers.yaml` (which we changed ~3.5 years ago around the time of a2f90453f).\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `compilers.yaml` check, as it likely does nothing 99% of the time now, and is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nAs this is the last pre-run check in Spack, I'm also removing the ability to have `pre_run` hooks, as they require listing the contents of the `hooks` directory and dynamically loading modules, which consumes time at startup.  If we need to do something pre-run in the future, we should do it some way that avoids using hooks or adding startup overhead.\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes all calls to `spack.config.get()` at module scope -- so that getting things like environment module configuration is lazy.  This should also save us a few config file reads at startup.\r\n\r\n- [x] remove pre-run hook\r\n- [x] also remove all module-scoped calls to `spack.config.get()`, to avoid parsing unnecessary YAML on startup.\r\n- [x] consolidate configuration `yaml` files in the `test/data/` directory to `test/data/config`\r\n- [x] mock configuration now includes `modules.yaml` configuration (module tests were only working because we determined if they were enabled at module scope)",
