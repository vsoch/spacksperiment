    "body": "I'm putting together a package which installs (among other things) python scripts which have hardcoded `#!/usr/bin/python` shebangs, and I would like to replace these with the version of Python used as an optional dependency for the package (if provided). I know I can get the appropriate path in the package definition file with `self.spec[\"python\"].prefix.bin.python`, but I wasn't able to figure out where to put the shebang replacing code. Is there some kind of post-install hook that I can implement?\r\n\r\n(I took a look at the documentation for `spack.build_systems.autotools.AutotoolsPackage` and `spack.package.PackageBase`, but maybe I missed something, in which case apologies!)",
