    "body": "It looks like none of the supported compilers interprets `-v` flag as a request for its version. What is more important is that most of the compilers (except for `xl` and `xl_r`, if I am not mistaken) interpret it as a request for verbose output. Therefore, we should switch to `vcheck` mode when `-v` is present in the command-line arguments only when the linker is called directly (one of the reasons why we should do it for `ld` is explained in #2501). There are at least two reasons why we should not switch to `vcheck` in other cases:\r\n1. The building systems (e.g. CMake and Autotools) often call compilers with `-v` and expect verbose output. In the `vcheck` mode of the compiler wrapper they do not get the real picture: `gcc ./test.c` and `gcc -v ./test.c` might do significantly different things since the compiler wrapper does not inject extra flags in the latter case.\r\n2. I often debug packages with `spack build-env ... -- bash` and it is very annoying that I cannot simply copy/paste the compilation command reported by make, prepend `-v` to the list of command-line arguments and see the real verbose output of the compiler.\r\n\r\nThis PR should fix the problem. I have two comments on it though:\r\n1. This does not solve the problem for `xl` and `xl_r`. We should have an exception for `-V` too when one of those is in use. However, it looks like that would require more changes and refactoring. We should probably expose `verbose_flag` to the compiler wrapper and switch to `vcheck` mode only if that flag is present in the command-line arguments.\r\n2. It is intended (for the consistency) that the `cpp` mode can now switch to `vcheck` mode too.",
