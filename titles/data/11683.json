This introduced a bug that compromises the correct execution of:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack compiler find\r\n```\r\nwhen no specific path is specified. Unit tests didn't catch the bug.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- [x] Adds a regression test that fails for the case reported #11678\r\n- [x] Fixes the bug by modifying the calling site in `spack/cmd/compiler.py`",
