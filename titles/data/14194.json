    "body": "Fixes:\r\n1. MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE problem with OpenMPI and UCX.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n1. OpenMPI provides two new depends_on options which result in UCX being compiled with multiple threads support. One implicit when OpenMPI 3.x is used, MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE is enabled by default, and one explicit for OpenMPI <= 2.x, MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE is disabled by default.\r\n2. Extends UCX package to allow \"Enable thread support in UCP and UCT\" option.\r\n3. Adds sha256 sums of UCX releases 1.6.1 and 1.2.0.\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\nFixes the issue with OpenMPI where programs that use MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE will fail to execute because UCP worker didn't support it.\r\nDuring the OpenMPI package installation, it's the +thread_multiple spec was not propagated to UCX nor UCX handled it at all.\r\nNow, the OpenMPI package is capable of handling +thread_multiple spec when UCX is request and the UCX package correctly handles +thread_multiple and compiles with the --enable-mt option.\r\nError message during runtime:\r\npml_ucx.c:226 Error: UCP worker does not support MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE",
