    "body": "UnifyFS had a bug with the `--enable-mpi-mount` config option, which corresponds to the `auto-mount` variant. This bug was fixed in the UnifyFS dev branch, however remains broken for the 0.9.0 version.\r\n\r\nThis adds a patch to the `unifyfs` package to fix the `auto-mount` variant when installing with version 0.9.0.\r\n\r\n**Update:** the following paragraph is no longer valid.\r\n\r\nThis also removes the `openssl` dependency as `unifyfs` does not directly depend on it. This was said to be a non-explicit dependency in #15258, but I have been unable to duplicate this. However, if it is needed, it is likely a non-explicit dependency of one of unifyfs's dependencies and should be added there.\r\n\r\nFixes: #15292",
