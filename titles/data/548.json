    "body": "I requested the following in my packages.yaml:\n\n```\n    pism:\n        version: [local]\n```\n\nThere is no version called \"local\" in pism/package.py; only 0.7.3.  The \"local\" version was installed by running \"spack diy\" (actually, spack spconfig, which is pretty equivalent for our purposes here).\n\nI then requested:\n\n```\nspack spec icebin@local +python +coupler +pism ^netlib-lapack+shared ^netlib-blas+fpic ^netcdf+mpi ^eigen~suitesparse ^python@3:\n```\n\nSpack tried to get pism@0.7.3, ignoring the request for local in packages.py.  My guess is it did an algorithm as follows:\n1. User made no version request on command line.\n2. Default in packages.yaml is \"lcoal\"; let's see if we can find such a version.\n3. pism/packages.py doesn't list any version called \"local,\" so let's throw that out\n4. No other defaults are listed in packages.yaml, so just use the latest version listed in pism/packages.py\n\nNot sure what the best approach to solving this issue is.  For now, I'm adding \"^pism@local\" to my command lines.\n",
