    "body": "Up to this commit `PackageBase.do_install` was installing the root package of a DAG unconditionally and its dependencies conditionally (depending on the value of the boolean argument `install_deps`).\r\n\r\nHowever, a sensible operation in many contexts is to install *only* the dependencies. This was not possible via API, and the code to do that was replicated in the implementation of `PackageBase.do_install` and of the `spack install` command. Further, the code in those two places was not doing *exactly* the same thing.\r\n\r\nThis commit extracts a new function that is used in both places, and is external to `PackageBase`. This choice has been preferred over extending `PackageBase.do_install` API because:\r\n- the method was already complex enough (10-15 arguments) and needed to be simplified \r\n- having a method on an instance that installs anything but that instance spec didn't seem a sensible choice",
