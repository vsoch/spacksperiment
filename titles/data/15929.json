    "body": "Currently the `spack ci start` command does two things:\r\n\r\n1. generate the pipeline (as the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file)\r\n2. push that generated file to `DOWNSTREAM_CI_REPO` with a generated branch name\r\n\r\nThis second step is needed until gitlab provides the dynamic child pipelines feature.  In the meantime, there are issues with the various ways available for authenticating that `git push` in step 2 above.  This edit to the documentation will hopefully make the caveats clearer to users of the current system, until we can do away with pushing the generated pipeline file.",
