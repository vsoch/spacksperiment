The submission was redone in order to clean-up extra merge commits.\r\n```Summary:\r\nAdd access to the master tree for a dyninst@develop version  Also, fix issues related to trying to build dyninst due to dyninst's transition away from libelf and libdwarf as they move to elfutils and elfutils dwarf. From comments I added to the dyninst package.py file:\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+    # Dyninst depends on libelf and libdwarf prior to 9.3.0\r\n+    # Dyninst depends on elfutils and libdwarf from 9.3.0 to but\r\n+    # not including 10.0.alpha\r\n+    # Dyninst depends on elfutils and elfutils libdw from 10.0.alpha onwards\r\n+    # elf@0 is an abstaction for libelf\r\n+    # elf@1 is an abstaction for elfutils\r\n```",
