    "body": "Update some things in hpctoolkit to prepare for a 2021.02.x release:\r\n\r\n  1. allow binutils to be built with +nls.\r\n  2. require libmonitor to be built with +dlopen.\r\n  3. allow rocm in more than just develop branch.\r\n  4. remove some conflicting setenv's in hpctoolkit module.\r\n  \r\n----------\r\n\r\nI have a little bit of a chicken and egg problem.  We're heading to a\r\nrelease and I need to merge our develop branch into master, but the\r\nnew master won't build without these changes.  (don't ask)\r\n\r\nMy plan is to make these updates and merge hpctoolkit develop into\r\nmaster.  Then I can fully test with everything in place.  Finally,\r\nwhen ready, I can tag the next release and update package.py with\r\nminimal changes.  But it takes two commits.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nWe do need to modify the module environment to remove some setenvs.\r\nI didn't want to dig into the internals of a spack env_modifications,\r\nbut I couldn't find a more structured way of doing this.",
