    "body": "Fixes #175, #469 by adding extra provenance to the `$prefix/.spack` directory:\n1. Writes the build environment out to a file, `$prefix/.spack/build.env`, alongside the already installed `$prefix/.spack/build.out` log.\n2. Creates a directory called `repos` within `$prefix/.spack/` that contains ALL package files (and associated patches) that were used for the build of a package and its dependencies.\n\nThe fact that (2) writes out ready-to-use package repos allows you to easily do `spack repo add` to use the packages again.  In conjunction with `spec.yaml`, this should allow the exact same build to be run twice.  Reading the spec, setting up a `RepoPath` for the rebuild, and running the build should probably be wrapped up into a spack command (`spack rebuild` or something). That's left to future work.\n\n(2) writes `package.py` for the root _and_ dependencies so that so that you still have full provenance if a dependency install is forcibly removed for one reason or another.  This could also be useful for rebuilding dependencies.\n\n@alalazo, @eschnett, @becker33, @mplegendre, @lee218llnl: check it out.\n",
