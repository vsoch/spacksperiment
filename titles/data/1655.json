Messes up Spack's tarball caching.\n3. Obscures missing dependencies (eg, some packages auto-download from PyPI)\n4. Can result in software that's installed in weird ways (eg, auto-downloaded packages are invisible to Spack).\n\nIs there a way Spack can run the install() method in a sandbox that lacks Internet access?\n",
