    "body": "Currently spack configuration files that are `--user` stored are directly saved into `~/.spack/`. When changes that modify the format of any of the configuration file are merged (for instace #561), this causes conflicts for users that want to try out the new version, but still rely on the old release for stability.\n\nA simple way to avoid this is to increase spack version number any time that it is considered sensible and store more than one set of configuration files:\n\n```\n~/.spack/0.8/\n~/.spack/0.9/\n...\n```\n\nspack should also ask whether a user wants to import configuration files from an older version on first use.\n",
