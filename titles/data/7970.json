    "body": "The purpose of this Issue is to collect together previous issues that relate to virtual dependencies, with brief annotations as to the nature of the relationship.\r\n\r\n#4595 (open)\r\n> Limitations introduced:\r\n> build-only dependencies cannot have virtual dependencies\r\nMany packages have `python` as a build dependency.  This fact, combined with Python as a virtual dep (#7966), combined with #4595, could break a lot of Python things.  Even now, the concretizer is not able to handle DAGs where `python@2` is a build dependency and `python@3` is part of the DAG somewhere else.  #2548 (of which #4595 is a sequal) would fix that, apparently.\r\n\r\n#7950 (Virtual Deps: packages.yaml versions not respected)\r\n\r\n#7901 (Ghost blas provider reported by spack)\r\n\r\n#6300 (Variants on Virtual Packages: mpi+cuda)\r\n#1712 (variants in virtual packages are not passed to providers)\r\n\r\n#3515 (On the interaction between DB and repositories)\r\n@alalazo said: \"For the record I think we should really... Change the mechanism used to detect if a spec is virtual or not\"\r\n\r\nPython as a virtual dependency python virtual-dependencies\r\n#7966 opened 5 hours ago by mkuron \r\n\r\nChange default elf provider on macOS  defaults macOS virtual-dependencies\r\n#7939 opened 4 days ago by adamjstewart \u2022 Approved\r\n\r\nSet default provider for every virtual package  defaults tests virtual-dependencies\r\n#7784 opened 15 days ago by adamjstewart \u2022 Approved  \r\n\r\nMake libelf the default elf provider again.  WIP bug concretization virtual-dependencies\r\n#3737 opened on Apr 6, 2017 by tgamblin \u2022 Approved  \r\n\r\nBug with spack find/uninstall and virtual deps bug concretization specs virtual-dependencies\r\n#2015 opened on Oct 13, 2016 by adamjstewart \r\n",
