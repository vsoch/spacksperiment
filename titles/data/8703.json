    "body": "Currently, Spack's compiler wrapper is hardcoded to use `/bin/bash`. However, if we changed this to `/bin/sh` and made things POSIX compliant, systems like Ubuntu that default to `dash` could see ~~vast~~ slight improvements to build times for large, complex packages. If we changed it to `/usr/bin/env sh`, Spack users could install `dash` on other systems and add it to their `PATH`, although I don't know how much `env` will slow down runtimes.\r\n\r\nIf no one else gets to this, I'll probably experiment with it eventually. I just wanted to make a dedicated issue before I forget.\r\n\r\nRelated to #4048. Probably depends on #7604. See https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/148035 for performance comparisons between common shells.",
