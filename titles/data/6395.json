    "body": "This PR adds bohrium to spack. Right now it is work in progress and the built package is still not functional, so please do not merge the PR just yet. I have tried a few things to find out what goes wrong during the build, but maybe you folks can give me some pointers for further investigation.\r\n\r\nHere are the things I did:\r\n- The package builds fine with all variant combinations, that I tried (With CUDA and OpenCL, with only one of them, with python3.6, with python 2.7, with and without any of BLAS or LAPACK)\r\n- If I try to use the package's python extension like so\r\n```sh\r\nspack module loads --dependencies bohrium > /tmp/modules.bohrium\r\n. /tmp/modules.bohrium\r\n\r\npython -c 'import bohrium'\r\n```\r\nI get the issue of an unresolved symbol, which turns out to originate from the `libstdc++` library,\r\nnamely `std::allocator<long>`.\r\n- The error originates from the `dlopen` executed by the `python` module. I am a bit puzzled by this, since running `ldd` on the `dlopen`ed library clearly shows that said `so` library contains a pointer to `libstdc++`, which is resolved properly under the environment setup shown above.\r\n- If I enforce loading the `libstdc++` and the `dlopen`ed library by setting `LD_PRELOAD` for the `python` environment, the import goes smoothly, but using anything from the `bohrium` module leads to an abort of `python` due to the same unresolved symbol encountered above.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther than that:\r\n- Is there a way to express dependencies between `variants` is `spack`?\r\n- If you consider 103 to 110, my issue is that I need to make sure that one of a few variants is enabled for Bohrium to work.\r\n- Is there a better way to check for this rather than in the `cmake_args` function.\r\n\r\nThanks for any pointers or feedback.",
