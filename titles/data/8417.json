    "body": "I finally managed to track down the build failure of newer qt's on our system. This PR adds the `-skip wayland` to the qt build for newer qt's. Wayland seems to be a replacement for `x` but wasn't shipped with our (fairly minimal) Ubuntu so the qt-build fails a couple of minutes in.\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly brutal solution, but I prefer it over adding a variant would only work on some systems. If someone needs it I'll add the links to the qtwayland documentation \r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.qt.io/QtWayland\r\nhttps://wayland.freedesktop.org/ubuntu16.04.html",
