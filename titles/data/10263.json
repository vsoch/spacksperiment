They are listed in the packages dependencies.  I will check the spack commit history.\r\n  - EDIT: [from the blame page](https://github.com/spack/spack/blame/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/r-factominer/package.py) seems like those three dependencies were commented out in the original commit.  Perhaps the spack packages were not ready yet at the time?",
