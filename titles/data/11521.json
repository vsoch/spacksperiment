    "body": "I'm in the process of creating a [new repository](/spack/localized-docs) so that we can make translations of the Spack documentation available in different languages.  Mainly looking at Japanese right now, to support Fujitsu and RIKEN teams working on Post-K, but other languages are obviously welcome.\r\n\r\nSee the [Sphinx Internationalization Docs] for details on how the process works.  I'll add a proper `README.md` on the new repo once this is all working, but the idea is to make it very easy for people to create and update translations continuously.\r\n\r\nTo support that, we need some changes to the Spack documentation build:\r\n\r\n- [x] refactor `conf.py` so that the doc language can be injected through the `SPACK_DOC_LANGUAGE`  environment variable on readthedocs.org.\r\n\r\nI'm also making the logic we've added to `conf.py` more \"vanilla\":\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a `--header` argument to `spack commands` that prepends text to its output.\r\n- [x] Add a `--update FILE` argument to `spack commands` so it'll only write output to `FILE` if a command has changed.\r\n- [x] Add a similar `--update` argument to `spack list` so that it will only update the package list if it needs updating.\r\n- [x] Remove custom code in `conf.py` and use the new command arguments instead.\r\n",
