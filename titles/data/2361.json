    "body": "This PR gets a GCC built python to use MKL for blas/lapack. This is not perfect and I\r\nhave put comments for TODO items.\r\n\r\nThe changes to intel-parallel-studio are to get the correct library path for blas. I was\r\nusing that to attempt to use it but there were a couple of other issues. The changes to\r\nthe mkl package are to get the proper paths in the environment module, similar to what\r\nwas done previously for the intel-parallel-studio package.\r\n\r\nFor py-numpy itself, the section title for the defaults changed from DEFAULTS to ALL with\r\nnumpy-1.10 so that is configured accordingly. Also, for MKL to be used there must be a\r\nsection called, '[mkl]'. Finally, the mkl_rt library is needed, especially when built\r\nwith GCC. As such, that library is made explicit in the [mkl] section of the config file.",
