Use app.add_domain() with override option instead.\r\n  sphinx.override_domain(PatchedPythonDomain)\r\n```\r\nThis PR fixes that. It also sets the minimum required version of Sphinx to 1.8, which is the version where the `override` option was added to `add_domain()`: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/extdev/appapi.html#sphinx.application.Sphinx.add_domain",
