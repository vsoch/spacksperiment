    "body": "This fixes a problem where the placeholder path was not in the first rpath entry. This was seen in c++ libraries and binaries because the compiler was outside the spack install base path and always appears first in the rpath. \r\n\r\nInstead of checking the first rpath entry, all rpaths have the placeholder path and the old install path (if it exists)  replaced with the new install path.  \r\n\r\nThe second commit changes the check for old install path strings by using the install prefix instead of the install root.",
