    "body": "<!-- Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\nExample: \"I ran `spack find` to list all the installed packages and ...\" -->\r\nHello,sometimes I get stuck when I perform an application installation, such as nag.\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install -v nag\r\n```\r\nI use the shell script to install the application in batches. When I install nag, it will jump to an interface and jam my script execution. I would like to ask if there are installation options to skip these manual operations?\r\nThe following is the content of the stuck interface.\r\n```console\r\n\r\n!\r\n! A license is required to use package 'nag'.\r\n!\r\n! * If your system is already properly configured for such a license, save this\r\n!   file UNCHANGED. The system may be configured if:\r\n!\r\n!    - A license file is installed in a default location.\r\n!    - One of the following environment variable(s) is set for you, possibly via\r\n!      a module file:\r\n!\r\n!       NAG_KUSARI_FILE\r\n!\r\n! * Otherwise, depending on the license you have, enter AT THE BEGINNING of\r\n!   this file:\r\n!\r\n!   - the contents of your license file, or\r\n!   - the address(es) of your license server.\r\n!\r\n!   After installation, the following symlink(s) will be added to point to\r\n!   this Spack-global file (relative to the installation prefix).\r\n!\r\n!       lib/nag.key\r\n!\r\n! * For further information on licensing, see:\r\n!\r\n!       http://www.nag.com/doc/inun/np61/lin-mac/klicence.txt\r\n!\r\n! Recap:\r\n! - You may not need to modify this file at all.\r\n! - Otherwise, enter your license or server address AT THE BEGINNING.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-77-98460b6f4\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.9\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu18.04-aarch64\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [ ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
