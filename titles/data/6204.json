    "body": "I have a local package repository that contains software that I want to install in a different `install_tree` than the normal spack location (`$spack/opt/spack`).  Is there a configuration option that allows me to do this?  \r\n\r\nThe idea is to keep installations of proprietary, locally developed packages separate from open source packages provided by spack.  As a work around, I may be able to hack `~/.spack/config.yaml` to temporarily use a different `install_tree`, but this is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to achieve this layout?",
