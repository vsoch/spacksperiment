    "body": "Resolves #4414.\r\nResolves #4334.\r\n\r\n`spack dependents` now shows *possible* dependencies for a package by default, and you can display dependents for an installed spec with `spack dependents --installed`.  By default it shows direct dependents; you can show all transitive dependents with `--transitive`.\r\n\r\nNote that previously the command only operated on installed specs, and it only showed all transitive dependencies.  The default behavior now is to show possible direct dependencies for packages.\r\n\r\nTODO: \r\n- [x] Show possible dependents instead of installed dependents\r\n- [x] `--installed` argument\r\n- [x] `--transitive` argument\r\n- [ ] add analogous `spack dependencies` command\r\n\r\nTwo things that I'll hold off on but might be interesting to think about:\r\n\r\n1. Only show dependencies through certain dependency types.  Really requires a little path expression language.  e.g., only show transitive run dependencies of direct build dependencies might be something like `spack dependents --type 'br*'`.\r\n1. Take partial specs and show only things that could possibly depend on *those*.  e.g. if you write `spack dependents foo@1.6` and `bar` can only ever depend on `foo@:1.5`, then `bar` shouldn't show up in the output.  This requires a fancier solver so I'll hold off on it.\r\n\r\n@samfux84 @adamjstewart @markcmiller86 ",
