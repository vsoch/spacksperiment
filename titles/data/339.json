Note that the source code, as well as my package, are named HDF instead of HDF4.\n\nPossible bugs:\n`spack versions hdf` does not find any Remote versions. However, this could be said about a lot of packages that have sites with weird naming conventions. `spack fetch hdf@<version>` works just fine, so I don't think it's a problem.\n",
