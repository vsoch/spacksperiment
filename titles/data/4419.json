    "body": "Not sure if discussions go here or outside of github, but anyway, I work on a project that is built on top of Trilinos. I have been putting a lot of effort into having my project use the Trilinos package file in Spack. Although I'm sure it's possible with enough effort and enough variants, I have not been successful with merging my custom Trilinos package file (https://github.com/NaluCFD/NaluSpack/blob/master/spack_config/nalu-trilinos/package.py) into the general one. In my opinion Trilinos is just too big to maneuver and experiment with. It takes over an hour to build the general Trilinos in Spack, and about 25 minutes for my custom Trilinos with only what I need enabled, so it's not easy to test modifications, especially when I need to experiment with modifying dependencies of Trilinos. I don't mind a maximal approach of Trilinos building everything, but I haven't been able to keep track of how many different errors I have encountered when trying to merge my set of options for Trilinos into Spack.\r\n\r\nMy main question is this: Since my project is very closely tied to Trilinos, what are anyone's thoughts that I just pack Trilinos into my project package file, or is there a higher level way I can select a full set of options I need so that I can simplify this?\r\n\r\nTagging @davydden since I think he has the most experience with Trilinos here.",
