    "body": "<!--\r\n*Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\nExample: \"I ran Spack find to list all the installed packages and...\"*\r\n-->\r\nHello, I'm trying to install [some applications](https://exawind-builder.readthedocs.io/) which use spack as package manage tool.\r\nIn the installation script of that application, it needs `module` command. Also, I find command module could be shipped with spack bootstrap(spack install environment-modules.\r\nHowever, it seems that when I execute spack bootstrap, it installs dependencies in another arch, namely \r\n\r\n    $ spack find\r\n    ==> 35 installed packages\r\n    -- linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64 / gcc@7.5.0 -------------------------\r\n    environment-modules@4.4.1  tcl@8.6.8  zlib@1.2.11\r\n    -- linux-ubuntu18.04-zen / gcc@7.5.0 ----------------------------\r\n    autoconf@2.69    hwloc@1.11.11        ncurses@6.0             pkgconf@1.6.3\r\n    automake@1.16.2  hypre@develop        netcdf-c@4.7.3          readline@8.0\r\n    boost@1.68.0     libiconv@1.16        netlib-lapack@3.8.0     superlu@4.3\r\n    bzip2@1.0.6      libpciaccess@0.13.5  numactl@2.0.12          tcl@8.6.8\r\n    cmake@3.16.2     libsigsegv@2.12      openmpi@3.1.5           util-macros@1.19.1\r\n    diffutils@3.7    libtool@2.4.6        openssl@1.1.1d          xz@5.2.5\r\n    gdbm@1.18.1      libxml2@2.9.8        parallel-netcdf@1.12.1  yaml-cpp@0.6.2\r\n    hdf5@1.10.4      m4@1.4.18            perl@5.30.1             zlib@1.2.11\r\n\r\nThis is different from `spack install` which will install on linux-ubuntu18.04-zen by default.  This causes even I can have command module in command interface, the script still cannot find the module command. \r\n\r\nI'm fully aware of similar previous issues, but i didn't find a solution after looking through all of them carefully, is there anyone could help me?\r\n\r\nMillions of thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n### Spack version\r\n<!-- Add the output to the command below -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.14.1-474-144557e94\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nmodule: command not found\r\n<!--If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error\r\nbut the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output. If there was no error\r\nmessage and no output but the result is incorrect, describe how it does not match\r\nwhat you expect. To provide more information you might re-run the commands with \r\nthe additional -d/--stacktrace flags:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack -d --stacktrace <command1> <spec>\r\n$ spack -d --stacktrace <command2> <spec>\r\n...\r\n```\r\nthat activate the full debug output. \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n<!--\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\n 1. which platform you are using\r\n 2. any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.)\r\n\r\n-->\r\nUbuntu 18.04\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
