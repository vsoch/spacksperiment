This is a necessary step before anyone can use an environment configured for use with a build cache.  Instead, I'd like to specify trusted GPG keys directly in the environment file and save users some typing.\r\n\r\nSomething like \r\n```\r\nspack:\r\n  mirror:\r\n   mymirror: http://url\r\n config:\r\n   gpg:\r\n     trust:\r\n     - Key1\r\n     - Key2\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to implement this, nor do I know how hard it would be to implement.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n",
