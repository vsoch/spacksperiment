    "body": "I was trying to build OpenMPI with clang-5.0.0 (installed from homebrew) on OS X and spack complained that it could not find m4, autoconf, automake, or libtool.  I solved this locally, by adding\r\n\r\n  depends_on('m4')\r\n    depends_on('autoconf')\r\n    depends_on('automake')\r\n    depends_on('libtool')\r\n\r\nbut I don't think that I should have.  It seems like the spack environment should have implicitly added these dependencies for AutotoolsPackages.",
