    "body": "@lee218llnl @JSquar \r\n\r\npy-gtk needs to build with python@2.7 and also requires atk, so the atk python dependency cannot be unconditionally constrained to @3:\r\n\r\nThis PR generally undoes the edits of https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/9102 (although it keeps the `gettext` dependency). Therefore, to build newer versions of `atk`, you must specify their version on the command line, e.g. `spack install atk@2.28.1`. More on this at https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/8133#issuecomment-389378055\r\n\r\nAnd this now also allows `spack install py-pygtk to succeed`.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/9102#issuecomment-431514107",
