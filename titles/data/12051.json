The reason for the bug is that the patches are stored in the same directory as the `package.py` file for which they are defined. If we inherit from `builtin.gcc`, we need to still find the patches associated with `builtin.gcc`. \r\n\r\nThe above package code will now work. We use python's method resolution order to find the first module which lives in a directory that also contains a patch file of the appropriate name.",
