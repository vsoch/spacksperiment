    "body": "This change updates the llvm Spackage to use the monorepo at https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.  This will be the primary code repository moving forward for the llvm-project.  In this repo all projects are side by side in a single tarball and projects are enabled with `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS`.\r\n\r\nTo enable flang in this structure, the flang fork of clang and llvm will need to replace the llvm and clang directories.  This is what I am doing below, but it requires a change allowing resources in Spack to overwrite a location.\r\n\r\nSomeone more familiar with flang could likely make a cleaner mapping from the flang forks to the monorepo releases.",
