    "body": "If you try to source a bash script using `os.system` or `subprocess`, it works, but since the script is sourced in a subprocess, none of the environment variables get propagated back to the current process. This PR allows package authors to call a `source` function, which properly assigns these variables to the current environment.\n\n@nrichart: This might be a simpler solution for your foam-extend package in #1002. The problem I see with your current solution is that `env` also reports back shell functions, which will mess up your environment.\n\nCredit for this clever use of json goes to:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/a/7198338/5828163\n",
