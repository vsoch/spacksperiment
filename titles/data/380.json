    "body": "Added netlib-scalapack that provides scalapack in prevision of vendor libraries also providing it.\nI used the setup_dependent_environment function to propagate the compilation values as discussed in #234. There is the same problem as for the R package #273 with the dependency on blas and lapack\n\nAdded mumps with default all precision and complex activated. `mpi` is also by default activated since in mumps they use a fake libmpi for the sequential case that tend to make me think that it is not the default intended behavior.\n\nThe 64bit integer variant is present but i could not test it since there is no blas/lapack/scalapack present with 64bit integers. If the external packages are merged, I will try with mkl ilp64.\n\nMumps examples are compiled only as a sanity check. They are not installed\n",
