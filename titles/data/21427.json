This as a way to compress the runner mappings logic\r\n\r\n(beyond 2 build images the current mapping syntax gets super inefficient)\r\n\r\nI'd like to assign a spec to build on two different OSes, and certain specs to be tagged uniquely. Mappings give us an opportunity to override runner-attributes from the defaults in .gitlab-ci.yml. I'm suggesting the possibility of multiple mappings overriding runner-attributes fields in order of the match list. I'd like to avoid writing out a separate match block for every combination of runner image and runner tags. For example, if I have 5 different runner images and three unique tag situations, then it is the difference between 8 match blocks or 15. It seems more scalable to me, but maybe I missed something",
