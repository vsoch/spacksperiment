The implicit:\r\n```\r\nfrom spack.pkgkit import *\r\n```\r\nstatement that was injected in the code at import time has been made explicit in each package. Therefore there's no motivation anymore for having custom importers instead of using `llnl.util.lang.load_module_from_file`. Here we remove the custom importers in 474c408 and we then update all the packages in db37622",
