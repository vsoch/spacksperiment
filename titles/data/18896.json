Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\nI have labelled this as an issue with arpack-ng, as that is the package that I am having trouble building, but I suspect the underlying issue is with intel-mkl.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nI have installed intel-parallel-studio following instructions at https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_systems/intelpackage.html#install-steps-for-packages-with-compilers-and-libraries.  I want to use fftw-api via MKL, but intel-parallel-studio does not support that, so I installed intel-parallel-studio with ~mkl and install intel-mkl separately, and then try to install arpack-ng.\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n( add a stub entry for intel@20.0.1 in compilers.yaml)\r\n$ spack install intel-parallel-studio@cluster.2020.1%intel@20.0.1 +advisor+clck+daal+gdb~ilp64+inspector+ipp+itac~mkl+mpi+newdtags+rpath+shared+tbb+vtune auto_dispatch=none threads=openmp\r\n(this installs w/out issue.
