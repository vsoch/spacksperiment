    "body": "It would be nice to have the ability to run a `spack find` to an upstream install_tree of Spack.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nWith our current pipeline, we have no way of knowing what our pipeline installed and with which dependencies. We would like the ability to point spack to a `spack-db` and be able to see what is installed there. Sometimes we need to see which dependency got linked with our package in case we need to add some details about it in the modulefile.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`spack find -ld --install-tree=/path/to/spack/install/tree` ",
