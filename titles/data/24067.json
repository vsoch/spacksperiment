    "body": "@becker33 Recently, I have not been able to use the spack-generated tcl modulefiles. I believe this is due to the recent changes in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/23703. It looks like the default filepath was flipped? Was that intented? Defaults [before](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/9b99f85abf208612fe8ff7d108b6a68d970706d8/etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml#L37-L40) and [after](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/c6d21fa154049241435aec0e5dcf929cfd8d4cc7/lib/spack/spack/modules/common.py#L223-L226).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack module tcl refresh -y\r\n$ module avail\r\n<none of the spack-generated modulefiles appear>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output. If there was no error message and no output but the result is incorrect, describe how it does not match what you expect. -->\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-2942-4a7b0af\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-power9le\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
