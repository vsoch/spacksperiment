Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install -v perl\r\n...\r\n*** Unexpected product version 11.0.\r\n***\r\n*** Try running sw_vers and see what its ProductVersion says.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis problem is basically due to Apple's bumping the version number to 11.0. It is actually resolved by this [PR](https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/17946). I believe that we just have to copy what they did.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-947-1aceb38b8\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-macos-skylake\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n\r\n[spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5335141/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n[spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5335142/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
