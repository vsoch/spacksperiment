    "body": "git comment covers most of if I think .. we were getting error messages, especially with \"spack -vd install\", because of \"/\" and \" \" characters in file paths, these came mostly from the hash component of Spec.short_spec. There was some inconsistency in the character used  to indicate a hash (\"/\", \"-\" and \"#\")\r\n\r\nIn this patch I've selected \"#\" as the hash prefix on the basis that \"-\" was already overloaded and \"/\"  was difficult for the filesystem - and us commonwealth speakers pronounce \"#\" as \"hash\" ;)\r\n\r\nSo throughout the code I've made \"#\" consistently the hash prefix. The parsers still recognize \"/\" as well as \"#\" though, for backwards compatibility and in case I missed any.\r\n\r\nIt now passes all of the tests it passed before and a few more\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\nSteve",
