    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n- To reproduce this issue you need to be on macOS.\r\n- Then after this, you need to create an environment, with the intention of replacing Homebrew/Anaconda, [reference](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows.html)\r\n- After that active any env, lets say for example, my env is named Neo, and here is the configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# This is a Spack Environment file.\r\n#\r\n# It describes a set of packages to be installed, along with\r\n# configuration settings.\r\n# This is a Spack Environment file.\r\n#\r\n# It describes a set of packages to be installed, along with\r\n# configuration settings.\r\nspack:\r\n  # add package specs to the `specs` list\r\n  specs: [bash, coreutils]\r\n  view: /opt/neo\r\n  config: {}\r\n  mirrors: {}\r\n  modules:\r\n    enable: []\r\n  packages: {}\r\n  repos: []\r\n  upstreams: {}\r\n  definitions: []\r\n  concretization: together\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Now you need to run software, that you had installed in your Mac/Darwin machine, and it isn't installed by Spack, for example here I use `code` command line tool from visual studio code and otool, and we get an error message:\r\n\r\n```dyld: Symbol not found: _iconv\r\n  Referenced from: /usr/lib/libarchive.2.dylib\r\n  Expected in: /opt/neo/lib/libiconv.2.dylib\r\n in /usr/lib/libarchive.2.dylib\r\n/usr/local/bin/code: line 10: 26217 Abort trap: 6           ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 \"$ELECTRON\" \"$CLI\" \"$@\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- As we see here is using /opt/neo to search for libiconv, the same happens, in for example otool.\r\n```spack \u276f otool -L code

all I dumped my environment variables using the `env` command, and this is the part that was particularly suspicious:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLIBRARY_PATH=/opt/neo/lib64:/opt/neo/lib:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib64:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib\r\nCPATH=/opt/neo/include:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/include\r\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/neo/lib64/pkgconfig:/opt/neo/lib/pkgconfig:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib64/pkgconfig:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib/pkgconfig\r\nDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/neo/lib64:/opt/neo/lib:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib64:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib\r\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/neo/lib64:/opt/neo/lib:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib64:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib\r\nACLOCAL_PATH=/opt/neo/share/aclocal:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/share/aclocal\r\nMANPATH=/opt/neo/share/man:/opt/neo/man:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/share/man:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/man\r\nSPACK_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib64:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib\r\nSPACK_DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib64:/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo/.spack-env/view/lib\r\nSPACK_ENV=/Users/dsmc/spack/var/spack/environments/neo\r\n_=/usr/bin/env\r\n```\r\n\r\n-So I had an idea, I know that on Darwin the environment variable `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` tells Darwin where to search for libraries, so what I did, I unset this environment variable with the following command:\r\n\r\n`unset DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`\r\n\r\n-This made everything work as expect, I think the issue is that this is getting set in some part of the modules, I tried running some Spack installed programs, and they worked fine (Since these programs are linked properly), so unsetting doesn't cause an issue.\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n```\r\nProductName:\tMac OS

We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
