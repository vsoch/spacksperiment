Spack should clean up automatically.\n\nFor example, after installing PETSc successfully, Spack should clean all previous PETSc staging directories that it left behind.\n\nOr maybe it should only using a single staging directory for PETSc, and not a new one for each attempt.\n\nAs is, the amount of disk space used is a trap; people might not even be aware of it.\n",
