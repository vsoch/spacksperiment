    "body": "As discussed in #10319 and discovered by @adamjstewart py-jupyter-notebook only depends on `node-js` and `npm` for mimification, which they do as part of their release process. Unfortunately the github releases are not releases in that sense, but from their point of view these constitute a from-source install. \r\n\r\nI dropped the dependencies and switched to pypi, unfortunately not all github-releases have a counterpart on pypi, so I dropped the missing ones and replaced the checksums by the output of `spack checksum`, the latter is required as all tar-balls differ (obviously), but in the default change from md5 to sha256 we had the discussion whether we should accept mass hash changes from \"untrusted\" sources, so I'm unsure on how to proceed here.\r\n\r\nAfter this change `py-jupyter-notebook` no longer conflicts with `python@3:`",
