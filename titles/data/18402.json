    "body": "Fix for #12547 which points out that the `font-util` resource `font-bh-ttf` fails to obtain write access for the fontconfig directory `/etc/fonts` on certain systems (e.g. centos7). This bugfix adds `--with-fc-confdir` to the `configure` arguments for all font resources, as suggested by @hainest.\r\n\r\nOnly one font currently supports this flag, but all fonts accept the option without effect. If we wanted to be stricter, we could check whether `XORG_FONT_FC_CONFDIR` is in `configure.ac` and only use `--with-fc-confdir` on those fonts that support the flag, but that seemed like much work for no different behavior. The risk with this current approach is that 1) a font could implement `--with-fc-confdir` to mean something different than the fontconfig directory (low risk), or 2) `configure` could start to throw an error on invalid flags (low risk). Both of these would only happen in a new version: 1 would sneak through, but 2 would likely be caught in testing for that new version.",
