    "body": "Sphinx was missing all of its dependencies. No one noticed because setuptools automatically pulls them down from PyPi if it can't find them, but that won't work on machines without internet access.\n\nAll of the dependency information comes from the `setup.py` files in each tarball.\n\nI updated all of the packages to the latest version available on PyPi. Note that several of these latest versions don't work with the traditional URL scheme:\n\n```\nhttps://pypi.python.org/packages/source/<first_letter_of_package/<package>/<package>-<version>.tar.gz\n```\n\nIf anyone can figure out why these versions don't work, please let me know. For now, I hardcoded the hash-specific URLs. @lee218llnl?\n",
