    "body": "This PR adds support for a `spacktivate` alias with bash completion that is interpreted as `spack env activate`. I put it in the bash completion file because it is a *first-class* action, i.e., it needs to be recognized without spack, and it is always active (unlike `despacktivate`, which is only defined when an environment is active). If there is a better location, or implementation, I'm happy to update this PR. The csh version is a simple alias.\r\n\r\n@junghans @tgamblin",
