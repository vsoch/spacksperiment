This PR updates the checksum, and switches older patched to sha256. The older patches did not change, only the latest patch.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a dependency on `autoconf-archive`. Without this, `mpfr` fails during the build stage with the following error message:\r\n```\r\nconfigure:14208: error: possibly undefined macro: AX_PTHREAD\r\n      If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.\r\n      See the Autoconf documentation.\r\nmake: *** [configure] Error 1\r\nmake: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....\r\n```\r\nDepends on #15784",
