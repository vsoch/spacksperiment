This is important so that the checks we do on PRs are meaningful, and so that it's easy to contribute compliant code without having to fix others' issues.\n\nI added a few exceptions:\n- [x] Visual indents (which seem hard to fix and don't add much to the code in the situations I've encountered)\n- [x] The checker script makes exceptions for URLs and file paths exceptions a bit more aggressively now.\n- [x] Factor out the various `json` schemas from `config.py` into their own modules, which should make the code easier to manage.\n\nSee what you think before this goes in. \n@adamjstewart @davydden @alalazo @robertdfrench @becker33\n",
