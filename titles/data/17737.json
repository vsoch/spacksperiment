This patch adds `PYTHONPATH` to the variables that are setup in `spconfig.py`. \r\n\r\nI don't see any tests currently for `spack setup` so I haven't written one here. And I wouldn't really know where to start in writing a test for this kind of use case. However I hope this patch is simple and pretty obvious... ",
