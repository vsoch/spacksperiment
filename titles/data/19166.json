Turns out you need to fetch things from the login node, rather than do that on the compute node...\r\n\r\nHad to teach `spack fetch` to gather its todo list from an environment. Let me know if you want to keep this \r\n\r\n* previously: `spack fetch` required the explicit statement of\r\n              the specs to be fetched, even when in an environment\r\n* now: if there is no spec(s) provided to `spack fetch` we check\r\n       if an environment is active and if yes we fetch all\r\n       uninstalled specs.",
