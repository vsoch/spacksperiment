I have checked with `spack checksum catalyst` that the checksums are correct.\r\n\r\nNote that none of these versions can be installed, though (neither could any of the previous ones, actually): there is a problem in a python script called during the `do_stage` phase. It seems the problem will be corrected for version 5.6.0. Meanwhile catalyst can be installed manually and added to one's packages.yaml file.",
