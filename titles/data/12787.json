I have found go forums online that hint at the possibility of a naming conflict as `GO` is installed first. Then `Go-md2man` is installed and is creating identical files, thus causing the error. I cannot confirm this is the actual issue at this time however. Steps to reproduce are as follows below: \r\n`spack install charliecloud@0.10+builder+docs`\r\nThe resulting error output is below.\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install
