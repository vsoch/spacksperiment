The current Go release at that point was v1.12, which supported modules.\r\n\r\nThe initial commit for this package set the build directory up to use the old-style GOPATH build system and defined a resource for the blackfriday markdown parser.\r\n\r\nThe package should use the build system intended by the go-md2man project, Go modules.\r\n\r\nThe package should *not* have overridden the copy of blackfriday that the go-md2man authors vendored into their repository, indeed it's not clear to me *which* copy the build actually uses.\r\n\r\nThe sole downside is that the build will not work for go@:1.10.8, which did *not* support modules.  Since the official Go support policy is\r\n\r\n> Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.\r\n\r\nthis is probably *not* an issue now, although it may have been a consideration when the package was originally submitted.",
