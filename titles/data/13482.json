    "body": "As a user I would like a warning to be either printed to screen or logged somewhere in debug mode when targets are downgraded by Spack so that I can spot deviations from the preferences expressed in e.g. configuration files more easily\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nFollowing a discussion happened on public Spack's slack in the #general channel. A `spack.yaml` file like the following:\r\n```yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  specs:\r\n  - mvapich2 fabrics=mrail\r\n  packages:\r\n    openssl:\r\n      buildable: false\r\n      paths:\r\n        openssl@1.0.2: /usr\r\n    all:\r\n      target: [skylake-avx512]\r\n  concretization: together\r\n```\r\nwas causing all the specs to concretize as `x86_64`. This is because there's a typo in the preferred target that contains a dash where it should have an underscore i.e. `skylake_avx512`. \r\n\r\nWhat was happening is that Spack was falling back to a safe target after having tried to use a \"non-existing\" preference. Being a typo the error was hard to spot and probably it would have been much easier to debug if Spack prompted a visible warning about its decision to downgrade the target.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMake it such that Spack prompts a warning when it decides to downgrade targets. The warning should be as informative as possible on where and why this decision was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nNo additional information",
