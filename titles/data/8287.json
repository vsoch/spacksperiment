Move it to the top, as that section is before the one with the WITHs\r\n * Several options were missing :BOOL\r\n * -DWITH_ZLIB doesn't actually exist as an option\r\n\r\n(I'm just going to hope that the options in the opencv recipe previously are the only ones people want, there is a _lot_ of potential busywork there)",
