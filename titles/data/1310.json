    "body": "This is intended to resolve https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/1308\n\nIt is a WIP on account of the second point below\n\nThere are two changes:\n- Firstly mirror URL fetchers created in Stage.fetch use the 'expand' member of the default fetcher\n- Secondly I felt that the resource retrieved by the mirror should have the same name as if it were retrieved from the web URL (if I make the first change here that still causes a problem WRT https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/1233). As far as I could tell this was actually intended with the implementation of Stage.expected_archive_files: it returns the mirror path as well as a path based on the current fetcher. URLFetchStrategy.fetch uses the first expected_archive_files element to choose the output filename for curl (which originally was the path based on the current fetcher URL); the current fetcher is either the default or a mirror so I changed it to reference Stage.default_fetcher (since the non-default case was covered by using the mirror path).\n\nIf I was wrong about expected_archive_files I can also modify URLFetchStrategy to optionally save to a specified file and choose that explicitly. If having expectations on the name of the staged file is considered problematic I think this can be handled another way.\n",
