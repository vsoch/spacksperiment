Following the documentation I do,\n\n```\nbash-4.1$ spack edit -f gccxml\n==> Error: Package gccxml not found.\n```\n\nThe `-f` is supposed to create the `packages.py` file even if the package is new. \n\nTurning on debug, I get,\n\n```\nbash-4.1$ spack -d edit -f gccxml\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/lyon/Development/spack/spack/bin/spack\", line 154, in main\n    return_val = command(parser, args)\n  File \"/Users/lyon/Development/spack/spack/lib/spack/spack/cmd/edit.py\", line 127, in edit\n    edit_package(name, args.repo, args.namespace, args.force)\n  File \"/Users/lyon/Development/spack/spack/lib/spack/spack/cmd/edit.py\", line 65, in edit_package\n    path = repo.filename_for_package_name(name)\n  File \"/Users/lyon/Development/spack/spack/lib/spack/spack/repository.py\", line 321, in filename_for_package_name\n    return self.repo_for_pkg(pkg_name).filename_for_package_name(pkg_name)\n  File \"/Users/lyon/Development/spack/spack/lib/spack/spack/repository.py\", line 67, in converter\n    return function(self, spec_like, *args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/Users/lyon/Development/spack/spack/lib/spack/spack/repository.py\", line 304, in repo_for_pkg\n    raise UnknownPackageError(spec.name)\nspack.repository.UnknownPackageError: Package gccxml not found.\n```\n\nThe `repo_for_pkg` function demands that the package exists. \n\nThe `spack edit -f` feature is a nice one - can it be restored?
