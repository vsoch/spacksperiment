Spack can now contact a monitor server and upload analysis -- even after a build is already done.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this adds:\r\n- [x] monitor options for `spack install`\r\n- [x] `spack analyze` command\r\n- [x] hook architecture for analyzers\r\n- [x] separate build logs (in addition to the existing combined log)\r\n- [x] docs for spack analyze\r\n- [x] reworked developer docs, with hook docs\r\n- [x] analyzers for:\r\n  - [x] config args\r\n  - [x] environment variables\r\n  - [x] installed files\r\n  - [x] libabigail\r\n\r\nThere is a lot more information in the docs contained in this PR, so consult those for full details on this feature.\r\n\r\nAdditional tests will be added in a future PR.",
