    "body": "I'm working to enable LLVM to self-host by default.  From what I can tell there are two primary steps to enabling this.\r\n\r\n1. Add additional steps to build LLVM+clang before the main build.\r\n2. Enable the use of the newly built compiler.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe thought is to extend the phases of the LLVM Spackage to include `stage1-cmake, stage1-build1`.  Alternatively we could make a `llvm-stage1` Spackage that could be depended on or run the additional steps using `@run_before('cmake')`, but these solutions seem misleading for what we want to do.\r\n\r\nEnabling the newly built clang could be done by pointing directly to it with `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER` , though this is bypassing Spack.  The other thought was to temporarily register the new compiler during the build.  I had the thought of having a `'temporary'` configuration scope, but  I'm not familiar enough with the Spack core to know if that is a reasonable/desirable solution.\r\n\r\nAny feedback on how best to address these steps or other issues that need to be handled would be appreciated!\r\n",
