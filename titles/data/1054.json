    "body": "Why do we ignore certain files when activating Python extensions? If I remove the ignore statements, Spack crashes and says the file already exists, but why is this a problem? From my experience, if two packages contain the same file, it's always been identical to the original. I don't see why we can't symlink a file if it doesn't already exist, and skip it if it does. I'm currently running into problems with #1044 due to the fact that sites.py is ignored for all Python extensions.\n",
