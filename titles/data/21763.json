    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a project which aims to be a Paraview pugin. I have created a spack recipe for it and a spack environment to build it. Now I want to generate modules associated to this env. I use for that _spack module tcl refresh_ and it works fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, as my project is a paraview plugin, I need to \"inform\" my paraview installation that this plugin is available by setting the **$PV_PLUGIN_PATH** variable. Ideally, when I load my project module, I want this variable automatically set.\r\n\r\nI try to find a way to indicate in the spack recipe of my project that during the module generation, it have to set this variable. I have read the spack doc all the day, and I have not find something which do that. My question is : \r\n\r\nIs it a way to do that or not yet ?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading =)\r\nEloise\r\n",
