    "body": "As reported in #418, `spack install scipy` does not work because numpy has such specific dependencies. Previously, the only workaround was to specify `spack install scipy ^netlib-blas+fpic ^netlib-lapack+shared`. This PR addresses the issue by allowing numpy to be built with any blas and lapack implementation.\n\nNewer versions of these packages were added as well. I tried installing openblas@0.2.16, py-numpy@1.9.2, and py-scipy@0.15.1, but when I ran `import scipy.linalg`, I would get the error `_flapack.so: undefined symbol: sgegv_`. Apparently, openblas removed some deprecated symbols that older versions of scipy still depended on. The newest versions do not exhibit this problem.\n\nThe url for numpy was broken, so I updated both numpy and scipy to what I thought would be better homepages.\n\n@alalazo: these changes will slightly conflict with #485. How do you feel about my proposed changes?\n",
