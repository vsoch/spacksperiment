    "body": "Fixes a problem in ymake-filter: The line buffer is currently hardcoded to be 2048 bytes large but some Makefiles contain lines longer than that. This caused the Makefiles to sometimes not be generated, consequently failing parts of the build.\r\n\r\nThis used to work with GCC 6 but since updating to GCC 7, I have observed sporadic errors when building ncl. The patch has already been forwarded to upstream.",
