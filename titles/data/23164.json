    "body": "For historical reasons we are building kcov at version 3.4 from sources in our CI. The main motivation was that there was no system package for it in `ubuntu:18.04`, which was the default `ubuntu-latest` virtual environment for GitHub Actions up to not so long ago.\r\n\r\nSince a while `ubuntu-latest` points to `ubuntu:20.04` and there is a `kcov-38` package installable using `apt`. That though gives linking failures during tests that might need to be investigated.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/spack/spack/runs/2398568838?check_suite_focus=true \r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nError message is in the logs above\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis happens on the `ubuntu-latest` virtual environment. So far I didn't try to reproduce it outside of it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n",
