    "body": "Fixes #2181 \r\n\r\n@BarrySmith has a point.  I got annoyed enough about the file modifications to fix this.  The new `spack flake8` command runs all the checks in a temp directory and doesn't modify any files.  Oh and it's python and a spack command so you don't have to know where it lives.\r\n\r\n@citibeth @adamjstewart @davydden @alalazo \r\n\r\n- Ported old run-flake8-tests qa script to `spack flake8` command.\r\n- New command does not modify files in the source tree\r\n- Copies files to a temp stage modifies them there, and runs tests.\r\n- Updated docs and `run-flake8-tests` script to call `spack flake8`.",
