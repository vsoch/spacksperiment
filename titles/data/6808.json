    "body": "+ Ideally, we would make Metis a CMakePackage, but `metis@:5` doesn't use CMake.\r\n+ For now, provide a `build_type=` variant similar what is found in CMakePackage.\r\n+ There is a potential for duplicate specification of `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` if both variants `+debug` and `build_type=` are specified. I am looking for advice on how this can be resolved.",
