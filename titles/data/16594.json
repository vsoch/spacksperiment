Clingo by default\r\ndoes an install in `~/.local`, so we need to disable that and add a few\r\nother options to get things right.\r\n\r\n- [x] add `bison` dependency\r\n- [x] add `re2c` dependency\r\n- [x] make `doxygen` dependency optional (and patch if needed)\r\n- [x] add options to fix `python` build\r\n- [x] make python build optional but on by default",
