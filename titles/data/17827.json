    "body": "Fixes #17469.\r\n    \r\n`spack buildcache list` was trying to construct an `Arch` object and compare it to `arch_for_spec(<spec>)`. for each spec in the buildcache.  `Arch` objects are only intended to be constructed for the machine they describe. The `ArchSpec` object (part of the `Spec`) is the descriptor that lets us talk about architectures anywhere.\r\n    \r\n- [x] Make it easier to get a `Spec` with a proper `ArchSpec` from an `Arch` object via new `Arch.to_spec()` method.\r\n    \r\n- [x] Pull `spack.architecture.default_arch()` out of `spack.architecture.sys_type()` so we can get an `Arch` instead of a string.\r\n    \r\n- [x] Modify `spack buildcache list` and `spack buildcache install` to filter with `Spec` matching instead of using `Arch`.\r\n\r\n- [x] regression test",
