    "body": "<!--*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*-->\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nCurrently, compiler flags are passed down the dependencies. This may not always be desirable and may result in inflating package installation. More often than not, I only want to use `-g` debug flag for package `A` and I don't want the debug flag to be used for every single dependency package. \r\n\r\n<!--*Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it!*-->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!--*Describe the solution you'd like and the alternatives you have considered.*-->\r\nI'd like to have something like:\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n   trilinos:\r\n    flags:\r\n      cppflags: \"-g\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n<!--*Add any other context about the feature request here.*-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
