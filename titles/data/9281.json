    "body": "MPICH has official versions 3.2 and 3.2.1. We also have a patch that needs to be applied for the version 3.2 but not for the version 3.2.1. Thus, we have a condition for that patch: `when='@3.2%clang'`. The problem is that, according to Spack, the version 3.2.1 also satisfies this condition. To work around this issue, I made all the version tuples to have the same length.\r\n\r\nProbably, this has the same root as #6524 and #6526.",
