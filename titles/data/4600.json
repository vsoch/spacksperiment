    "body": "- Can cleanup various depends_on flex/bison min version restrictions\r\n  since spack no longer supplies flex, bison lower than these had\r\n  specified anyhow.\r\n\r\n- The buggy flex-2.6.2 has now been blacklisted in the corresponding\r\n  flex package (also removed the md5sum to avoid suggesting that this\r\n  version should be revived). The 2.6.3 has similar problems (at least\r\n  for scotch), but 2.6.4 seems to work.\r\n\r\n- Rejig flex restriction for scotch to exclude 2.6.2-2.6.3 only. Since\r\n  flex-2.6.4 appears to be okay again, we can remove the flex version\r\n  restriction that trickled through into the openfoam packages as a\r\n  consequent of an spack spec bug.\r\n\r\n- Make flex a build dependency for the openfoam packages\r\n  (seems to have been an earlier oversight).",
