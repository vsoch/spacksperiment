This adds a rudimentary check based on the presence of `-o`. This doesn't detect all cases of creating precompiled headers but doing that 100%-accurately requires parsing the input file from the command which would take significantly more effort.\r\n\r\nNote that I have tried building WxPython (mentioned in #8640, the current only test case for this) and it still fails but as far as I can tell right now it is not related to doing the wrong thing for precompiled headers (i.e. adding this patch gets past the original failure).",
