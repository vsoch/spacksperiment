    "body": "This thread is to further discuss the idea of data-only packages, as started by Lynn Garren:\r\n\r\n> We have several packages that consist of nothing more than data files.  For instance, the geant4 data sets are versioned and different releases of geant4 need to access different geant4 data sets.  But these take a fair amount of disk space and certainly have no compiler or other dependencies.  Is spack the right place to put such things?  Has this issue been raised before?\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spack/rl2OSwhj1cE\r\n\r\nForking this from @citibeth's #2469 because that ended up being about compilers.",
