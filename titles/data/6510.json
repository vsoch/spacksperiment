    "body": "Fixes for a few bugs identified recently.\r\n\r\n*Text not relocating as described here\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues/6418\r\n\r\nThis was caused by passing a regular expression to filter_file. Passing a literal string for old and new install paths works. Added a test to make sure it works. \r\n\r\n* Binary files identified by file with \"dynamically linked\" were being skipped by a check for \"link\" in file type. Changed the check to \"link to\" to cover symbolic links.\r\n\r\n* Unpacking a tarball is a spack install with a different directory layout caused errors because the basename of the prefix directory was included in the tarball. Removing the prefix directory fixes the problem. \r\n* Use the dag_hash for the working copy of install prefix to avoid confusion with install prefix.",
