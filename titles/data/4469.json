Though the python code then uses uppercase for the first letter in the class name to define the package.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest something like `logoname` which may be optionally included with a package next to `url` and `homepage` that holds the case-senstive (and perhaps funny chars included) package name so that I can do something like...\r\n\r\n```\r\n    logoname=\"AMReX\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then `spack info` would produce...\r\n\r\n```\r\nCMakePackage:    AMReX (amrex)\r\nHomepage:        https://ccse.lbl.gov/AMReX/index.html\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n```",
