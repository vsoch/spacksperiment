I didn't have much time to look at it again, so take my comments with some care.\r\n\r\nEssentially this delegates the ignore-conflicts stuff to `package.activate` and removes the `--force` flag. It also delegates the dependency resolution to the view generator and not on the single extension (this prevents double adding, but feels somewhat hacky).\r\n\r\nFeel free to comment and point out errors",
