    "body": "This change is done to avoid inconsistencies during refactoring. The rationale is that functions at different levels in the call stack all define a default for the 'dirty' argument. This PR removes the default value for all the functions except the top-level one (`PackageBase.do_install`).\r\n\r\nIn this way not defining 'dirty' will result in an error, instead of the default value being used. This will reduce the risk of having an inconsistent behavior after a refactoring.",
