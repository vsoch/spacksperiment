This has been broken since https://github.com/spack/spack/commit/87aec4134daba7dee43c958151b45ca72c02e617, which overlooked that specs read from files didn't have abstract specs.\r\n\r\nThis treats the spec initially read from the file as the abstract spec. Note if a user concretizes and writes a spec using logic like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> s = Spec('openmpi')\r\n>>> s.concretize()\r\n>>> open('openmpi.yaml', 'w').write(s.to_yaml(all_deps=True))\r\n```\r\n\r\n(i.e. in the `spack-python` shell)\r\n\r\nThat the spec initially read from this file will be the concrete spec (e.g. it will not simply be `openmpi`).",
