    "body": "After looking over PR #360 and its documentation in PR #989 more carefully, I found that the intended feature for specifying compiler flags in the `compilers.yaml` file is missing.  I was able to verify this by having something like the following in my `compilers.yaml` file:\n\n```\ncompilers:\n  chaos_5_x86_64_ib:\n    gcc@4.7.2:\n      ...\n      cflags: -fPIC\n      cppflags: -fPIC\n      cxxflags: -fPIC\n```\n\nThis inclusion caused an 'additional properties are not allowed ('cppflags', 'cxxflags', 'cflags' were unexpected)' error to occur when I attempted to install packages with this compiler.\n",
