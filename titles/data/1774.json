Splitting the Spack repo (#1773) was proposed as one technical feature that might help with this goal.  But it's not immediately clear how much that approach would help with the stated goal, and I think we need more discussion on other ways to get updates quickly.  Hence this thread.\n\nThis is also a continuation of OT discussion on #1696 \n",
