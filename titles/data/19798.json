    "body": "Fixes #19766 \r\n\r\nIn #18843, I added a patch to fix the build with Apple Clang 12. Although I was able to build Bash with that patch, the installation was buggy, causing #19766. This PR adds a more complete patch from Macports that fixes this issue. I modified the patch slightly to fix a linking issue with readline.\r\n\r\nI also added patches for older versions of Bash and added myself as a maintainer. I tested the 5.1-rc2 release without any of these patches and things work fine, so there's no reason to upstream this patch.",
