This changes it so that any dependencies of the root package will also acquire the same architecture.\r\n\r\nWe also did not set the front target into the cray platform as an attribute to the platform class. I would get an error where it would attempt to module swap x86_64 but obviously there is no need to swap since x86_64 is not a module. \r\n\r\nAddresses #4828 ",
