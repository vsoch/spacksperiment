Please describe it!*-->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!--*Describe the solution you'd like and the alternatives you have considered.*-->\r\nAs shown in https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc/-/blob/master/config/examples/arch-ci-linux-intel-mkl-single.py, it should be possible to configure petsc to use mkl_pardiso\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
