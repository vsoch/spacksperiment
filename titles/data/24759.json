    "body": "<!-- Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve. -->\r\n\r\nI was trying to build an environment with new compilers, and then turn that into a container., on a machine with externals My break happens way early in that process.\r\n\r\nAs of develop this morning: if I have spack externals, Spack can get deeply confused about what it should fetch, in a way that gives _bizarre_ errors. In my situation, I had a spack external of diffutils v2.8.1, which is way before the versions Spack actually tracks (3.7). When I move to build gcc in an environment, spack concretized to have a gcc that depends on diffutils 2.8.1, and then proceed to download it. Problem being, the URL recipe that works for 3.7 doesn't work for 2.8.1. This manifests as a \"no fetcher could retrieve diffutils v2.8.1\" error, which was really unintuitive (@jrood-nrel and @michaelkuhn had to help me out on Slack).\r\n\r\nAn ideal fix for me would be Spack realizing that it's trying to fetch a package it doesn't know about. For me, I'd like that to lead to either a hard fail or Spack trying a different version. But I'm mostly reporting this so that you know about it, I won't be the last person to hit this behavior\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nOn a machine with ancient diffutils (MacOS Mojave in my case)\r\n\r\n```console\r\nspack external find\r\nspack -d -k fetch diffutils\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output. If there was no error message and no output but the result is incorrect, describe how it does not match what you expect. -->\r\n```console\r\ns1042027:spack-dev-env dzpolia$ spack --debug --stacktrace -k fetch diffutils\r\nlib/spack/spack/main.py:469 ==> [2021-07-07-11:46:29.745113] Warning: You asked for --insecure.
