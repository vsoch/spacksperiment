    "body": "The main goal of this PR is to remove the `binutils` dependency from the GCC package. Every time I've ever built `gcc+binutils` (the default on Linux) it has crashed. Other users have reported the same thing.\n\nFrom what I understand, binutils was added as a dependency because someone tried building GCC on a system with an ancient version of binutils. This problem is already documented in Spack's [Getting Started](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#binutils) section. According to the documentation, `binutils` shouldn't be added as a dependency, mainly because every package containing C/C++/Fortran code _technically_ depends on `binutils`, but we don't want to add it to every package. Instead, users who run into this problem should build a newer version of binutils and add it to their environment manually. It's more of a Spack dependency than a GCC dependency.\n\nAside from binutils, this PR also updates GCC to use the new `AutotoolsPackage` base class and removes old hacks that are no longer needed. I marked this WIP because it should probably be tested on a few different OSes (mainly macOS) before it is merged.\n",
