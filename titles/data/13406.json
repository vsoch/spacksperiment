HDF5 detection is working robustly in QE 6.4.1, but only with MPI enabled. HDF5 detection is still having problems with the serial QE. I am working with the QE developers to get it fixed in the native configure, so we don't have to run these filter_files. Less headache for the people who maintain this package.\r\n",
