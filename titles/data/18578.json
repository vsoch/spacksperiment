It seems that a better solution would be to have superlu-dist and openblas tell packages that depend on them that they should be using the -fopenmp flag, but I am not sure if that is possible (or how to do so). \r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-ivybridge\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\nThe full spec I am building is attached:\r\n[spack-pesci-spec.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5190627/spack-pesci-spec.txt)\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5190630/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5190631/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
