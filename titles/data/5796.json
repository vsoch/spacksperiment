It might be useful in the outside world also...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nInternally we work against a branch named 'llnl/develop', which mirrors the public repository's `develop` branch.\r\n\r\nIt's useful to be able to run flake8 on our changes, using `llnl/develop` as the base branch instead of `develop`.\r\n\r\nInternally the flake8 subcommand generates the list of changes files using a hardcoded range of `develop...`.\r\n\r\nThis makes the base of that range a command line option, with a default of `develop`.\r\n\r\nThat lets us do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack flake8 --base llnl/develop\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich uses a range of `llnl/develop...`.",
