    "body": "The `<math.h>` implementation in libc++ distributed with clang@9 differs from the one in clang@8: it uses `#include_next` to include the system's `math.h`, which defines macros `DOMAIN` and `RANGE`. There are a few files in Silo that unwittingly use these macro-like names as type names. Since Silo has no public repo I can't submit a patch directly, but it looks like the upstream [fpzip library](https://github.com/LLNL/fpzip) is available and the [peccant source files have been fixed](https://github.com/LLNL/fpzip/blob/master/src/pcmap.h).\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn file included from read.cpp:3:\r\nIn file included from ./pcdecoder.h:5:\r\n./pcmap.h:17:13: error: expected member name or ';' after declaration\r\nspecifiers\r\n  typedef T DOMAIN;\r\n  ~~~~~~~~~ ^\r\n/usr/include/math.h:335:18: note: expanded from macro 'DOMAIN'\r\n\\# define DOMAIN         1\r\n                        ^\r\nIn file included from read.cpp:3:\r\nIn file included from ./pcdecoder.h:5:\r\n./pcmap.h:21:17: error: expected parameter declarator\r\n  RANGE forward(DOMAIN d) const { return d >> shift; }\r\n                ^\r\n/usr/include/math.h:335:18: note: expanded from macro 'DOMAIN'\r\n\\# define DOMAIN         1\r\n```",
