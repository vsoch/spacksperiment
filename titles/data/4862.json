If it contains a `configure` script, we assume it uses Autotools. If it contains a `CMakeLists.txt`, we assume it uses CMake.\r\n\r\nPreviously, if the tarball contained both files (presumably supporting both build systems) we chose Autotools by default. With this change, CMake becomes chosen instead. Let me know if there are any other build systems we should reorder.",
