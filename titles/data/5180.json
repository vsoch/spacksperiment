    "body": "This changeset modifies Travis configuration so that PRs with package only changes don't trigger unit-tests or build-tests, but they will exit early and fake a success instead. Consequently, coverage report is not submitted and will not be displayed for them. The time to execute a *fake test* is that of setting up the environment and varies approximately between 1-2 minutes (instead of ~10 minutes of most real tests).\r\n\r\nA preferable alternative would be to skip these stages entirely, but [that seems not possible right now.](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/7181). The major problem we still cannot get rid of is that we need in any case to wait for an OSX executor to become available - and that may mean a waiting time of even half an hour to get scheduled. ",
