    "body": "Enable logging (i.e. to syslog) actions a user takes in a spack environment. Especially:\r\n\r\n- `spack load`\r\n- `spack env activate`\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWe have a shared spack environment that our users use. It would be helpful to be aware of what packages are popular, and what are no longer needed.\r\n\r\n### It would be extra nice (but not necessary) if...\r\n\r\n... the contents/format of the message were configurable/template-able, and could include content from environment vars (eg. SLURM_JOB_ACCOUNT -- to not only track who was loading what, but for which project they were loading it).\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n\r\n`0.16.0-1918-f36370e7c9`\r\n\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
