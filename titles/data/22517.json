    "body": "Fixes #18853\r\nFixes #22487\r\n\r\nThe issue started with #22228. In that PR, we found that gtk-doc requires docbook-xsl to be pinned at 1.78.1. However, gdk-pixbuf requires version 1.79.2 in order to parse the style sheet for its man pages. The fix/workaround here is to make man page generation for gdk-pixbuf optional and default to turning off man page generation. \r\n\r\nThe consequence here is that we cannot build gdk-pixbuf with man pages when it is a dependency of gtk-doc. I think this will be an issue until gtk-doc moves forward and supports the newer version of docbook-xsl.",
