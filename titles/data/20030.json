    "body": "Example (using a package from https://github.com/key4hep/key4hep-spack, just because its version history is a nice illustration):\r\n\r\n```\r\n~$ spack versions marlin\r\n==> Safe versions (already checksummed):\r\n  master  1.17\r\n==> Remote versions (not yet checksummed):\r\n  01-17-01  01-16  01-15-02  01-15-01  01-15  01-14  01-13  01-12  01-11  01-05\r\n```\r\n```\r\n~$ spack versions --new marlin\r\n==> Safe versions (already checksummed):\r\n  master  1.17\r\n==> Remote versions (not yet checksummed):\r\n  01-17-01\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this is that a lot of packages have old versions that are outdated or not checksummed in the recipe for other reasons. As a maintainer, I'm mostly interested in checking for new versions - all the versions older than 01-17  in my example are basically noise. Together with `spack maintainers --by-user` this can then also be used to create automated checks, reminding me when new versions are available (not all of the packages I'm maintaining are on github, where I could configure notifications).",
