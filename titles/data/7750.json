My normal MO is to just add new packages to the list and fire it up, things that are already built are simply skipped over.\r\n\r\nNow that `aspell6-en` is an extension of `aspell` I activate it as part of the script.  If I re-run the script it fails when it tries to activate it a second time:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-bash-4.2$ bin/spack-install.sh\r\n==> aspell6-en is already installed in /home/hartzell/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-5.5.0/aspell6-en-2017.01.22-0-2dh6xidgk2ucjcs32uc3t7pak34kl5sy\r\n==> Error: Package aspell6-en/lc4v24f is already activated.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like a way to \r\n\r\n- activate a package without causing an error if it's already activated;\r\n- ask is a package is activated so that I can avoid reactivating it; or\r\n- some other mechanism to have a script run idempotently.\r\n\r\n",
