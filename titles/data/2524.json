    "body": "We need something like this (at least for now) because now we get unicode objects when we load from the json database. This leads to the problem of hash evaluation of already installed packages.\r\n\r\nFor example, when we do 'spack activate <python_extension>' we get the following error:\r\n_Error: Can only (de)activate extensions for installed packages._\r\n\r\nThis happens because when spack evaluates hash code, it gives yaml unicode strings and the latter, instead of returning:\r\n`{python: {version: 2.7.12, arch:...`\r\ngives this:\r\n`{!!python/unicode 'python': {version: 2.7.12, arch:`\r\n\r\nThe solution is based on this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/33571117",
