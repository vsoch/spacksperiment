    "body": "Although all versions of `py-pyprecice` use `setuptools`, older versions override the `distutils` version of `install`, so the `--single-version-externally-managed` flag wasn't being respected. This PR replaces the `distutils` version of `install` with the `setuptools` version. By using `filter_file`, a single line can be used instead of a different patch for each version.\r\n\r\nBy using Spack's default `install` method, the library will be installed to the correct location, even for external system Python installations.\r\n\r\nTested 2.0.0.1 and develop on Ubuntu 20.04 with Spack-installed Python 3.8.11 and GCC 9.3.0. Can someone test with an externally installed Python for me? Would be good to test other versions too.\r\n\r\nCloses #25035\r\nCloses https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/issues/86\r\nCloses https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/issues/87",
