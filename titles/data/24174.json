After checking out the system I ran the benchmarks on I realized it had https://xalt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ enabled by default, which slows down compilation tremendously. When I disable xalt, the bootstrap phase is much faster and adding -O3 flags does not make a significant change, so I'm happy to revert this.",
