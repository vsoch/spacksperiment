    "body": "Zsh and newer versions of bash have a builtin `which` function that will show you if a command is actually an alias or a function. For functions, the entire function is printed, and our `spack()` function is quite long. Instead of printing out all that, make the `spack()` function a wrapper around `_spack_shell_wrapper()`, and include some no-ops in the definition so that users can see where it was created and where Spack is installed.\r\n\r\nHere's what the new output looks like in zsh:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ which spack\r\nspack () {\r\n\t: this is a shell function from: /Users/gamblin2/src/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh\r\n\t: the real spack script is here: /Users/gamblin2/src/spack/bin/spack\r\n\t_spack_shell_wrapper \"$@\"\r\n\treturn $?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `:` is a no-op in Bourne shell; it just discards anything after it on the line. We use it here to embed paths in the function definition (as comments are stripped).",
