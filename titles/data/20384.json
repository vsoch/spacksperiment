This adds a `.mypy.ini` that checks all of the `spack` and `llnl` modules, though not yet packages, and fixes all of the identified missing types and type issues for the spack library.\r\n\r\nDepends on #20376 because of how I built this up, but could probably rebase that out if it's an issue.\r\n\r\nIn a related note, how would folks feel about having a Mypy run in CI?",
