    "body": "Just for fun, I tried to install an older version of gcc on my Arch machine. I was greated with the following error message:\n\n```\nspack install gcc@5.4.0\n==> Installing gcc\n==> Error: Specs gmp@6.1.1%gcc@6.2.1 arch=linux--x86_64^libsigsegv@2.10%gcc@6.2.1 arch=linux--x86_64^m4@1.4.17%gcc@6.2.1+sigsegv arch=linux--x86_64 and gmp@6.1.1%gcc@6.2.1 arch=linux-None-x86_64 have the same SHA-1 prefix!\n```\n\nI suspect this is really happening because spack isn't detecting my architecture or OS correctly, but however it happened, you can see that both packages different arch properties. The manual leads me to believe that this should cause their hashes to differ, but apparently not.\n",
