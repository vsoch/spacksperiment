Install \"version.txt\" into the documentation directory (doc). Removed installing \"README.md\" (from LIBXSMM's root directory) as it overrides the README.md already provided in the documentation folder. The latter uses the correct relative references to the other parts of the documentation.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Apparently, \"FC=/path/to/gfortran spack install libxsmm\" is currently needed for Spack since does not pick-up the Fortran compiler (but incorrectly uses the C compiler instead).",
