Where this causes an issue is if one is using intel compilers the relevant patch doesn't get applied as explained in [8303](https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/8303).\r\n\r\nThis issue is also referenced [here](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/5745).\r\n\r\nCan this be fixed by modifying the setup.cfg file ?
