    "body": "Avoid matching recurringly nested include paths that most certainly refer to internally shipped libraries in packages.\r\nExample in CUDA Toolkit #13819 #13983, shipping a libc++ fork internally with libcu++ since 10.2.89: `<prefix>/include/cuda/std/detail/libcxx/include`.\r\n\r\nQuick fix #13969 \r\n\r\nA more thorough solution is not to recursively search for headers anymore since this is against the idea of C/C++ facade headers: https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/13969#issuecomment-561929481 Unfortunately, it's not that easy for us to find which headers are facade and which ones are detail, but I am not sure we have to know anything besides the include dir locations.\r\n\r\nGenerally, just searching for *any* `include/` in the overall path (instead of just taking the `<prefix>/include`) is dangerous as well. For example, spack could be installed in `/my/large/software/include/here/is/axels/home/src/spack/` ;-)\r\n\r\nGeneral policy suggestion: just add `<prefix>/include` to the build environment by default. Packages that break this unix-wide default should provide the\r\n```py\r\n@property\r\ndef headers(self):\r\n```\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart mentioned on Slack that some Python packages might need special treatment, let's see if we can find examples again to double check.",
