    "body": "The ABINIT configure collects linker options from the linker command which the compiler driver actually executes, and passes them on to the compiler driver.\r\nWhen building with Fujitsu compiler ver.4.3.0 or later, one of the options causes an error in linking Fujitsu libraries.\r\nTo avoid this error I fixed the configure. This PR adds the change to the patch file.\r\nI confirmed this patch works for both of the Fujitsu compiler ver.4.3.0 or earlier and later.",
